            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1 That the Sanctified and ≈øeparated time of the Lords Day is ju≈øt according to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day.</p>

            <p n="4">4 That the Natural day, and ≈øo con≈øequently the Lords Day, doth begin with the Natural morning, and doth end with the Natural evening at Mid-night.</p>
            <p>And for the want of the knowledge of the≈øe things, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:36425:3"/>
that many godly per≈øons do the works of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Callings in ≈øome part of the Lords ≈øanctified and ≈øeparated day, as tho≈øe do that begin and end the Lords Day at the Sun-≈øet Evening, and for their better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I forced my ≈øelf to compo≈øe this Treati≈øe.</p>
            <p>I finde that the chief ground of their error do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>h ari≈øe, Fir≈øt, from a mi≈øtaken interpretation of the fir≈øt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, to be a full Night of twelve hours; and Secondly, from a mi≈øtaken interpretation of the word Evening, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they apprehend it to bee nothing el≈øe but a full Night.</p>
            <p>The≈øe and ≈øundry ≈øuch like mi≈øtakes, I conceive I have cleared, I pre≈øum'd therefore that this in≈øuing Treati≈øe will be heartily welcome to every tender Con≈øcience, that doth truly de≈øire to give unto the Lord his own ≈øeparated and ≈øanctified time.</p>
            <p>Many godly Chri≈øtians, to my knowledge, have been much exerci≈øed in their Studies, and Meditations, to finde out the true limits of the Lords Day, that ≈øo they might ab≈øtain from the works of their particular Calling, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of that ≈øanctified and ≈øeparated time, from the beginning of the day to the full end thereof.</p>
            <p>For their ≈øakes al≈øo, and at the ≈øpecial reque≈øt of ≈øome of them, I have laboured in this Treati≈øe, to prove, That all the time of the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe was comprehended in the word Morning at la≈øt, and that it took its beginning from the Mid-night at la≈øt, namely, as ≈øoon as all the ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Natural day were ≈øhaped and ≈øet into their order.</p>
            <p>And therefore the beginning of the Morning from the time of Mid-night mu≈øt not be a≈øcribed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the fir≈øt Authors of it (as many unadvi≈øedly do,) nor yet to any other Nation; but it is the mo≈øt ancient Scripture-Computation
<pb facs="tcp:36425:3"/>
from the very fir≈øt created day; and ≈øo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently it mu≈øt needs be the true beginning of the Jews Sabbath.</p>
            <p>This Tenent may happily ≈øeem ≈øtrange at the fir≈øt, to ≈øuch as have long held, both in their judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øe, That the Jews Sabbath (and ≈øo con≈øequently the Lords Day) did properly begin at the Sun-≈øet evening; and of this judgement and practice are mo≈øt of the Churches in <hi>New England,</hi> and in that re≈øpect many Profe≈ø≈øors among them do without ≈øcruple take liberty in the Sun-≈øet Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lords Day, to do the ≈øervile works of their particular Callings, and others take liberty to u≈øe Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But it is worthy to be taken notice of, that whole Churches do many times erre, both in their judgement and practice, or el≈øe how could ≈øo much Corruption, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtition, Idolatry, and Prophanene≈ø≈øe creep in to ≈øeveral reformed Churches, as there hath done from time to time in ≈øundry ages?</p>
            <p>Being therefore intreated by ≈øome godly per≈øons in <hi>New England,</hi> and being al≈øo moved thereunto by the fear of God, I have taken this difficult Task in hand, le≈øt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this corrupt judgement and practice, it ≈øhould ≈øpread like Leaven, to the corrupting of Po≈øterity; and ≈øo I re≈øt,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecau≈øe the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe wanted a Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light going before it, which is a proper adjunct, and a true part, of a true created night; and therefore the fir≈øt created night was not without it; and our owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth witne≈ø≈øe that every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat night hath a Twilight going before it in the evening as a true part thereof as well as a Twilight in the end of it in the morning: But the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe, though it had a Twilight in the end of it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the light ≈øhined out, yet it wanted a Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the beginning of it; therefore it was not a full night: it was no more but a Synecdoche <hi>Membri,</hi> a part of the fir≈øt night.</p>
                  <p>And indeed there could not be a compleat night at fir≈øt, not untill the Artificial day was fir≈øt compleatly formed by the ≈øhining out of the light twelve houres together, and then at the end of the ≈øaid twelve houres the light went out of that horizon, and then there ≈øucceeded another darkne≈ø≈øe of twelve Houres which began with a Twilight. The fir≈øt halfe of this darkne≈ø≈øe made up the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe to be a compleat night
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36425:10"/>
of twelve houres; and the other halfe went on towards the beginning of the ≈øecond natural day.</p>
                  <p>And thus, after this order and manner the fir≈øt night was created, ≈øhaped and limited, with a double Twilight, and by this means it became a true pattern and ≈øampler to all the other Creation nights.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Wil≈øon</hi> in his <hi>My≈øtical Ca≈øes,</hi> in <hi>Aenigmate</hi> 35. propounds this nece≈ø≈øary Que≈øtion<hi>:</hi>

                     </gap> An≈øwer hereunto (≈øaith he) mu≈øt be referred to the fir≈øt Creation onely.</p>
                  <p>By this An≈øwer of his, it is evident that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap> did not hold the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe to be a true night, as mo≈øt Interpreters doe, though much ami≈ø≈øe in ≈øo doing.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øumme of what I have ≈øaid, may be drawn up into this Syllogi≈øm.</p>
                  <p>No Darkne≈ø≈øe that wants the true ≈øhape and form of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat night, can be called a compleat night.</p>
                  <p>But the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe wanted the true ≈øhape and form of a compleat night, becau≈øe it wanted a Twilight in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, which is an in≈øeparable adjunct to the true ≈øhape and form of a compleat night.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe cannot in proper ≈øpeech be called a compleat night.</p>
                  <p>The Propo≈øition is ≈øo clear that I need not prove it, becau≈øe no man I thinke will deny it.</p>
                  <p>The A≈ø≈øumption is thus proved, God made the Stars to rule in the night, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 17. And the Stars were ≈øet fir≈øt into their dominion in the Twilight Evening of the fourth day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 17. in re≈øpect whereof <hi>Job</hi> doth call them the Stars of the Twilight, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 9. But the Seventy Tran≈ølators call them the Stars of the night, becau≈øe they held <hi>Jobs</hi> Twilight to be a true part of the night; And <hi>Solomon</hi> doth likewi≈øe make the Twilight of the Evening to be a terme <hi>≈øynonimous</hi> with Darkne≈ø≈øe, and with the night, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9. And <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. ≈øaith there is the evening of the Sun, and the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Night, when the ≈øhining of the Sun is gone from off the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36425:10"/>
For the further proof of this, I refer you to Chapter 4. To my An≈øwer to the ≈øecond Objection.</p>
                  <p>But I will hereunto adde the de≈øcription of a compleat night, which may further enlighten this truth. <note place="margin">A compleat night is the ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øence of the Suns ≈øhining for the ≈øpace of twelve hours.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A compleat night is the ab≈øence of the Suns ≈øhining from off the face of the earth for the ≈øpace of twelve houres, when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, as the dayes were in the fir≈øt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This de≈øcription of the Night agrees with the te≈øtimony of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> immediately cited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Why doe you ≈øet out the ≈øhape and form of the fir≈øt Artificial day by the ≈øhining of the Sunne, and of the Night by the ab≈øence of the Suns ≈øhining? Seeing the Sunne was not created till the fourth day; It is likely that the light that was created the fir≈øt day did not then rule the day after the ≈øame manner as the Sun did on the fourth day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Though there was no Sun-≈øhine in the fir≈øt day, yet doubtle≈ø≈øe in≈øtead thereof the God of Nature, and the God of Order, did cau≈øe a certaine light to ≈øhine out of darkne≈ø≈øe, from the Element of Fire, in the ≈øelfe ≈øame manner and order, as he cau≈øed the Light to doe on the Fourth Day.</p>
                  <p>At the fir≈øt, the general matter of the Globe, called Earth, was without form, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. becau≈øe it was voyd of all ornaments for a time; in like ≈øort the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe was at the fir≈øt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed thing, and without any ≈øhape or form of a night, for a time; but after the ≈øpace of five or ≈øix houres God ≈øaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> Gen. 1. 3. It were too gro≈ø≈øe blindne≈ø≈øe, to think that God did cau≈øe this Light to breake out of darkne≈ø≈øe all on a ≈øudden, like a fla≈øh of Lightning; no, God was now framing the Fir≈øt Day, to be a Patterne, and Sampler to all the re≈øt; and therefore the God of Nature, and the God of Order, did cau≈øe the Light to breake out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe by degrees, in the ≈øame order and manner as he cau≈øed the Sunne to doe on the Fourth Day, and ≈øo by this meanes the God of Nature did fir≈øt create a Twilight to the fir≈øt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, before he cau≈øed the light to ≈øhine out upon the face of the Earth, as he did by the Sunne on the Fourth day; then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo he cau≈øed the Light to a≈øcend by degrees, until it came to its height at mid-day, and then he cau≈øed it to decline by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36425:11"/>
until it went off from that Horizon, as the Sunne doth now; and ≈øo by this meanes the Artificial Day was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øhaped, and formed, before the whole Night could be ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and formed.</p>
                  <p>But ≈øecondly, When the Artificial Day was thus formed, by the ≈øhining of the Light twelve houres, then there ≈øuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another Twilight, and twelve houres Darkne≈ø≈øe more then the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe; the fir≈øt halfe of that twelve houres darkne≈ø≈øe made up the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe a compleat night of twelve houres, with a double Twilight, and ≈øo it became a true patterne and ≈øampler to all other Creation Nights, and then the la≈øt halfe of the ≈øaid twelve houres darkne≈ø≈øe went on towards the beginning of the Second Day.</p>
                  <p>And except this order be ob≈øerved, there cannot be found out a double Twilight to make the fir≈øt Night a compleat pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for all the other Creation nights.</p>

                  <p>It is evident that the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe was not a compleat night by the order of that Dominion which God e≈øtabli≈øhed for the ruling of the Artificial Day by the Sun, before he gave Dominion to the Moon, and to the Starres, to rule the night.</p>
                  <p>But if the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe had been a full night before the Artificial day had received its ≈øhape and form, then the Moon and Stars ≈øhould have had their dominion before the Sun, for doubtle≈ø≈øe the God of order would place them in their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the day of their creation, according to that priority of order which the day had of the night, or the night had of the day. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. 19.</p>
                  <p>If the night of the fourth day had been fir≈øt in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Artificial day, then the Moon and the Stars ≈øhould have had the priority of their dominion to rule the night of the fourth day, before the Sun could have had its dominion to rule the artificial day; and ≈øo by this account the Sun ≈øhall borrow its light from the Moon as the chiefe≈øt in the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the fourth day: Is not this to make the God of order to be the God of confu≈øion, in ≈øetting the Cart before

the Hor≈øe, by giving the fir≈øt dominion to the Moon, and the la≈øt dominion to the Sun; as they do that make the fir≈øt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe to be a compleat night.</p>
                  <p>Or el≈øe if you think to avoid this Rock, by ≈øaying that the Sun only was created on the fourth day to rule the artificiall day, and that the Moon and the Stars were not created, and ≈øet into their rule and dominion till the fifth night, is not this to run again≈øt the plain Text.

                  <p>If the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe had been formed into a compleat night before the light was formed into a compleat artificiall day; Then doubtle≈ø≈øe <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> would have called it Night (as the proper name of its perfect ≈øhape and form) before he called the light Day: for it was Gods u≈øuall cu≈øtome to give names to things in the ≈øame priority of order, as they had priority of form and ≈øhape: As for example, As ≈øoon as he had made man of the earth, he called him <hi>Adam,</hi> and as ≈øoon as he had made woman of his Rib, he bid <hi>Adam</hi> name her; and as ≈øoon as he had formed other creatures, he brought them to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; bid him name them with names, defining their natures; &amp; ≈øo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs if the fir≈øt <hi>darknes,</hi> had been fir≈øt form'd into a compleat <hi>night,</hi> he would have named it night in the fir≈øt place; but he called it nothing el≈øe but Darkne≈ø≈øe at fir≈øt, ≈øaying the darkne≈ø≈øe was, namely it was a mi≈ø-≈øhapen and uncreated thing: But as ≈øoon as he had put a ≈øhape, and limited it by a double Twilight, he called it night, as the name of its perfect form and ≈øhape: But it could not receive this ≈øhape and form untill the light was fir≈øt ≈øhaped and formed into an artificial day by its orderly ≈øhining upon the face of the earth for twelve hours together, and then he called it day, as the proper name of its perfect ≈øhape and form.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may cleerly perceive, That <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. doth name all the parts of the fir≈øt natural day in their true pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of order as they were ≈øhaped and formed, 1 Day, 2 Night, 3 Evening, 4 Morning.

the fir≈øt formed part of the naturall day, was the artificiall day, and not the night.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Why do you go about to make the mo≈øt wi≈øe Creator and Governour of all things, to be an imperfect Arti≈øt in his fir≈øt pattern? for if you make the fir≈øt Night to want a Twilight in the beginning of it, do you not thereby make him an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Arti≈øt in his fir≈øt pattern to the other creation dayes? for it is manife≈øt, that the ≈øhape and form of the fir≈øt creation day was a true pattern by which the re≈øt were ≈øhaped and formed; for as the text expre≈ø≈øeth it in ver≈øe 5. ≈øo was the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ≈øo was the Evening the fir≈øt day; ≈øo in like ≈øort it is ≈øaid of the ≈øecond day in ver≈øe 8. and ≈øo it is ≈øaid of the third day in ver≈øe 13. and ≈øo it is ≈øaid of the fourth day in ver≈øe 19. and ≈øo it is ≈øaid of the fifth and ≈øixth days, all the≈øe dayes were ≈øhaped and formed ju≈øt according to the pattern of the fir≈øt day.</p>
                  <p>The addition of the Sun in the fourth day made no new part of Light more then the fir≈øt day had, as I have noted it already, and therefore the manner how the Light did break out of Darkne≈ø≈øe on the fir≈øt day, was in the ≈øame manner and order as we ≈øee the Sun doth in the Equinoctial.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Light a≈øcended out of darkne≈ø≈øe by degrees, as the Sun doth now, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. By means whereof it did fir≈øt make a Twilight in the morning, ≈øo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phra≈øe calleth it in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119. 147.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 Then it cea≈øed to a≈øcend, and made a little ≈øtand for about halfe an hour.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 Then it made a Twilight, called the Twilight of the Evening, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Then ≈øucceeded twelve hours darkne≈ø≈øe, the fir≈øt half whereof made up the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe a full night.</p>

                  <p>In this admirable order did the God of nature ≈øet together all the parts of the fir≈øt naturall day: But I have again ≈øet it out more fully in Section 4.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 By proving that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. divided the fir≈øt natural day into two equall parts two ≈øeveral wayes, as I have exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified it by the lines of longitude and latitude on a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe Diall in <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. and ≈øee al≈øo the gradations to the morning in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. at Sixthly.</p>

But the be≈øt way to an≈øwer this, and many
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36425:13"/>
other Objections, is to lay downe the true interpretation of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, in the various u≈øe of it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that <hi>Gnereb</hi> is u≈øually interpreted to ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <note place="margin">The Hebrew word Gnereb, which is tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Evening, in Gen. 1. 5. explained.</note> a mixing, or mingling of things together; but I di≈ølike this interpretation, becau≈øe it is not po≈ø≈øible by this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find out the true form, &amp; ≈øhape of the Natural Evening, I have therefore made diligent ≈øearch into the various u≈øe of this word, and I finde that <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth ≈øignifie (not a confu≈øed mixing and mingling of things together, but) a connexing, conjoyning, or coupling of two or more di≈øtinct things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without confounding their ≈øeverall ≈øpecies, or natures, and therefore Wine and Water mixed together cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gnereb,</hi> neither can the confu≈øed mingling of Light and Darkne≈ø≈øe together (as it is in the Twilight) be called <hi>Gne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb,</hi> and yet that ≈øhort time of Twilight is comprehended within the large limits of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> becau≈øe it is the partition of <hi>(Gnarbaiim)</hi> the two Evenings; but the Twilight it ≈øelfe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expre≈ø≈øed by two other ≈øeverall Hebrew words, and never by <hi>Gnereb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thing I ayme at in this Di≈øcour≈øe is only to clear the true ≈øignification of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> from a confu≈øed mixing or ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of things together, and to make it clear and evident, that it only ≈øignifies a conjunction of two or more di≈øtinct things together, and therefore that <hi>Gnereb</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. mu≈øt ≈øignifie the conjunction of the la≈øt halfe of the Artificiall day to the fir≈øt halfe of the Night, and that the≈øe two di≈øtinct parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed are an even and equal portion of time to <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning.</p>
                  <p>2. I wil explaine the true meaning of this phra≈øe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. ≈øo was the Evening, and ≈øo was the Morning. Fir≈øt mark the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; in the former part of the Ver≈øe, it is ≈øaid, <hi>God called the light Day, and the darkne≈ø≈øe he called Night;</hi> and then it follows, ≈øo was the Evening; but how was that? was it framed out of the darkne≈ø≈øe only? No, it was framed and formed both out of the ≈øaid Light called Day, and out of the ≈øaid Darkne≈ø≈øe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Night, <hi>Conjunctim,</hi> and not <hi>Divi≈øim,</hi> namely, the Evening was framed by conjoyning the latter halfe of the Artificiall

day to the fir≈øt halfe of the Night; and ≈øo was the Morning, namely, it was in like ≈øort framed out of the Darkne≈ø≈øe called Night, and out of the Light called Day, by conjoyning the la≈øt halfe of the Night to the fir≈øt halfe of the Artificiall day: and it is mo≈øt evident that this was the true meaning of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes;</hi> becau≈øe he doth afterwards explaine <hi>Gnereb</hi> the ≈øingle Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings eleaven times over, and the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the ful Natural evening hath two parts; namely the fir≈øt halfe is Day, and the latter halfe is Night, as I ≈øhal open the matter more at large, both in this Chapter by and by, and in Chapter the fift.</p>
                  <p>And from this interpretation of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. the≈øe three Conclu≈øions do follow.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 That the Fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe is not, nor cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening.</item>
                     <item>2 That the whole Night is not, nor cannot be called <hi>Gne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb</hi> the Evening, in a proper ≈øen≈øe.</item>
                     <item>3 That the Twilight cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe none of the≈øe three have any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinct conjunction of ≈øpecies to make them <hi>Gnereb;</hi> and from this interpretation of <hi>Gnereb</hi> I frame this Argument.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe by it ≈øelfe con≈øidered cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, neither can the confu≈øed mixture of the Twilight be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, becau≈øe <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth ≈øignifie (not ≈øuch a mixture as is confu≈øed, but) a connexing, or conjoyning of two or more things together, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their di≈øtinct ≈øpecies; and there are no other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinct ≈øpecies in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. to be conjoyned together, but the Light called Day, and the Darkne≈ø≈øe called Night.</p>
                  <p>But the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe was pure darkne≈ø≈øe, and no other thing was connexed to it til the Light was created, and that connexion though at the fir≈øt it might have been called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> yet now it mu≈øt not be called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> becau≈øe it plea≈øed God to call it <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the fir≈øt Darkne≈ø≈øe by it ≈øelfe con≈øidered, cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, neither was it framed into any part of the Evening at all.</p>

is called <hi>Ramothaim</hi> in the dual number, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 1. ≈øome Tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators render it the two <hi>Ramaths</hi> in mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but indeed they are deceived, for there is but one <hi>Ramath</hi> in Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and that <hi>Ramath</hi> is called <hi>Ramothaim</hi> in the dual number, becau≈øe it had two parts, and ≈øo <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> is u≈øually called <hi>Jeru≈øalaim</hi> in the duall number, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 5. 6, 7. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 51. 18. not becau≈øe there were two <hi>Jeru≈øalems,</hi> but becau≈øe the City <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> had two principal parts; for fir≈øt, There was the City of the people on the one part; and ≈øecondly, There was the City of <hi>David</hi> and mount <hi>Zion</hi> on the other part; but neither of the≈øe parts alone could properly be called the City of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> but both parts mu≈øt be put together to make up the full City <hi>Jeru≈øalem;</hi> and in this re≈øpect it might well be called the double <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> or the twy-party <hi>Jeru≈øalem;</hi> the like may be ≈øaid of <hi>Ramothaim,</hi> for there was but one City in Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> that was called <hi>Ramath,</hi> as ver≈ø. 19. tels us, But this City was called <hi>Ramothaim</hi> in the duall number, becau≈øe it had two principall parts. Fir≈øt, There was the City of the people on the one part; And ≈øecondly, There was <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramath</hi> on the other part where the High place was, and where <hi>Samuel</hi> dwelt, and kept a Prophets School, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 18, 19. But neither of the≈øe parts could properly be called the full City <hi>Ramath,</hi> but both of them together did make up the full City <hi>Ramath.</hi> So al≈øo <hi>Diblath, Ezek.</hi> 6. 14. is <hi>Diblathaim, Jerm.</hi> 48. 22. And ≈øo <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening is ≈øometimes called <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings, but neither of tho≈øe two Evenings taken a part can properly be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the full naturall Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it is meant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. but both of them put together do make up the full natural Evening; and in this re≈øpect <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> may be tran≈ølated the twofold evening or the twy-party evening, as well as the two Evenings, becau≈øe indeed there is but one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Evening, which is divided by the time of Sun≈øet into two principall parts. It is therefore but a woodden ≈øhift of ≈øome Scholars to call the fir≈øt Evening an improper Evening, and to call the latter Evening onely the full naturall Evening: The like woodden ≈øhift it is to make no other part of time to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gnereb</hi> properly, but the very beginning of the Night, or of the later Evening onely, as ≈øome do interpret <hi>Junius</hi> Annotation on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. to ≈øpeak.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Holy Spirit had framed <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> to ≈øet out both a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36425:20"/>
proper and an improper Evening with one and the ≈øame voice and breath, then doubtle≈ø≈øe the ≈øeventy Tran≈ølators being He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <note place="margin">The ≈øeventy Interpreters do make the two Evenings to be but one proper Evening.</note> Doctors would have found it out, and then they would have de≈øcribed the various acceptation of the word, by ≈øome marke of di≈øtinction or other, e≈øpecially con≈øidering they took liberty to vary the terme of their tran≈ølation from <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> for they do never fully expre≈ø≈øe the term <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings in any place, but nine times over they tran≈ølate it by the ≈øingle term Evening, and therefore if they had accounted the fir≈øt part of it to have been an improper Evening, and the latter part onely proper, then doubtle≈ø≈øe they would ≈øomewhere or other have given ≈øome mark of di≈øtinction whereby to know them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øunder, e≈øpecially ≈øeeing they take liberty to alter the phra≈øe; But it ≈øeems to me they accounted both the parts of <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> to be but one proper naturall Evening, becau≈øe they do nine times over tran≈ølate <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> by the ≈øingle term Evening. I confe≈ø≈øe they doe once after a ≈øort ≈øet out the two parts of <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5. for there the Seventy read the Text thus. In the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the month, between the middle of tho≈øe things that belong to the Evening; in this tran≈ølation they doe not fully name the two Evenings, but yet after a ≈øort they doe name the two Evenings, becau≈øe they ≈øay between the middle of tho≈øe things that belong to the Evening; their meaning mu≈øt be this, In the beginning of the Pa≈ø≈øeover Evening, they in the fir≈øt place did offer the daily evening Sacrifice, burne Incen≈øe, trim the Lamps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, As ≈øoon as the latter evening was come (which did, alwaies begin at Sun-≈øet) they began to fea≈øt upon the fle≈øh of their Pa≈ø≈øeovers, and of their Peace-offerings, in a ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn religious manner<hi>:</hi> Now between, or in the middle of the≈øe things all their Pa≈ø≈øeovers were ≈øacrificed. And thus by this Interpretation it appears evidently that the ≈øeventy Tran≈ølators held <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> to be but one proper naturall evening divided into two princiall parts, becau≈øe they called that which was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two evenings, the middle of the evening in the ≈øingular number. Therefore I may well conclude, that their di≈øtinction is ab≈øurd, that make the fir≈øt part of <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> to be no more but an improper evening, and that make the latter part onely proper. I think no man that is well advi≈øed can find any harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Scripture by this Interpretation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:36425:20"/>
3. It is al≈øo evident that <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, is as large in length of time as <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings is; for not onely <note place="margin">The Hebrew text doth make the two Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be but one proper Evening.</note> the Seventy do tran≈ølate <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> by the ≈øingle term Evening; but the Hebrew Text it ≈øelfe doth often put <hi>Gnereb</hi> for <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> interchangeably, as for example, four places of Scripture doe command them to offer the daily evening Sacrifice between the two evenings, but many more places ≈øay it ≈øhould be done or ≈øacrificed in <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening; five places command all the Pa≈ø≈øeovers to be ≈øacrificed between the two evenings, but more places ≈øay it ≈øhall be done or ≈øacrificed in <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening; one place ≈øaith, that the Prie≈øts mu≈øt cau≈øe the Lamps to burne between the two evenings, but other places ≈øay in the evening; one place ≈øaith the Quailes came between the two evenings, but other places ≈øay they came in <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening: Therefore <hi>Gnereb</hi> and <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> is but one proper evening; <hi>Gnereb</hi> is as large in time as <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> is, both parts together make up the true and proper naturall evening called <hi>Gnereb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I conclude, that the Hebrew word <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth not <note place="margin">The two parts of Gnereb ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified.</note> ≈øignifie ≈øuch a confu≈øed mixture as is between light and darkne≈ø≈øe in the Twilight; but it ≈øignifies ≈øuch a di≈øtinct connexion of Day and Night together, as may be called <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> the two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venings, and ≈øuch a connexion as may be di≈øtingui≈øhed or ≈øevered from each other into two di≈øtinct parts: as I may exemplifie the matter by a party-coloured coat, one half is white and the other halfe is black; ≈øo is <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening, the fir≈øt halfe is white called day, and the other halfe is black called night, and the time of Twilight that couples the≈øe two evenings together, may be likened to the ≈øeam that couples the white and black peeces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the compleating of the party-coloured coat. Or thus, the two parts of <hi>Gnereb</hi> may be exemplified by the cloud that ≈øtood between the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> the one halfe of the cloud was light towards the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> and the other halfe was dark towards the <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> 14. 20. So is <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the natural evening, the fir≈øt halfe is light called day, and the other half is dark called night.</p>
                  <p>But if the naturall evening had been nothing el≈øe but night, as mo≈øt Interpreters doe affirme upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. then all evening Sacrifices mu≈øt have been offered in the night time only; but the Hebrew Doctors wil laugh that opinion to ≈øcorn as a foule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurdity;

for after Sun-≈øet (≈øay they) the blood of all Sacrifices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unlawful, ≈øee <hi>Ain≈ø. in Lev.</hi> 6. 9. (they mean it only of all evening Sacrifices) and therefore it was a foul mi≈øtake in K. <hi>James</hi>'s Tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators to tran≈ølate <hi>Gnereb</hi> by the word night, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </head>
                  <p>THe fir≈øt Scripture by which I prove that the Natural Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth begin at Mid-day, at the fir≈øt declining of the Sun, is from <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who≈øe ≈øpeech is both plain and elegant, <hi>Jeremy</hi> ≈øpeaks thus in the per≈øon of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Souldiers, <hi>Ari≈øe, let us go up at noon; woe unto us, for the day declineth, and the ≈øhadowes of the evening are ≈øtretched out, Jer.</hi> 6. 4. The≈øe words are ≈øpoken by way of allu≈øion; but yet two phra≈øes are remarkable in this Text. 1. The day declineth. 2. The ≈øhadowes of the evening are ≈øtretched out; both the≈øe termes are Synonima, and mean the ≈øame time of the day; for as ≈øoon as the day begins to decline, the ≈øhadowes of the evening begin to be ≈øtretched out. Hence then it follows, 1. That the evening doth begin as ≈øoon as the day begins to decline. 2. That the ≈øhadowes of the evening do begin to ≈øtretch them≈øelves as ≈øoon as the ≈øun which rules the day, doth begin fir≈øt to decline.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeremy</hi> ≈øpeaks the≈øe words in the per≈øon of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who made ha≈øte to de≈øtroy the Jewes by the Noon-tide, but when they were upon their march they ≈øaw they were like to come ≈øhort of the appointed time, and therefore they cry out in an angry pa≈ø≈øion, <hi>Woe unto us, for the day declineth, and the ≈øhadowes of the evening are ≈øtretched out.</hi> The Prophet ≈øpeaks this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36425:21"/>
by way of Pro≈øopopeia; yet there mu≈øt be a reall truth in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I prove that the natural Evening begins at Mid-day, at the fir≈øt declining of the Sun, by <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>When the Evening was come; Luke</hi> expounds this evening to be come, when the day began to go down or decline, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 12. So Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders the Text: And when el≈øe doth the day fir≈øt begin to go down or decline, but when the Sun that rules the Day doth fir≈øt begin to go down or decline? as is above ob≈øerved from <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 4. And experience doth tell us, that the Sun doth fir≈øt begin to decline at mid-day, and that it continues declining till Sun-≈øet; So then, from the term Evening in <hi>Matthew</hi> de≈øcribed by this adjunct in <hi>Luke,</hi> when the day begins to go down or decline, it may truly be gathered by nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence, that the natural evening doth begin at mid-day, at the fir≈øt declining of the Sun; and this evening hath two parts, the fir≈øt part begins at the fir≈øt declining of the Sun, as I have already expounded, v. 15. and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evening doth begin at Sun-≈øet, in v. 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I prove that the full natural evening begins at mid-day, at the fir≈øt declining of the Sun, by <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the Pa≈ø≈øeover at Evening, at the going down of the Sun, at the ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon thou came≈øt out of</hi> Egypt. This Text is very pregnant to prove the point in que≈øtion; but becau≈øe I have occa≈øion to expound this Text at large in chap. 5. Therefore I refer the Reader thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I prove that the full natural Evening begins at mid-day by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>David</hi> doth there intreat <hi>Jonathan</hi> to meet him on the third day at Even, and it appears that <hi>Jonathan</hi> was very careful to ob≈øerve the punctual beginning of this appointed evening, becau≈øe it was a matter of weight, and becau≈øe <hi>David</hi> depended upon his punctual ob≈øervation of the preci≈øe time, therefore <hi>Jonathan</hi> did confirm his promi≈øe by an oath, ver. 13. be≈øides, <hi>David</hi> did over and above all this charge <hi>Jonathan</hi> to come to him quickly or diligently, that is to ≈øay, to be exact, and to keep the appointed time diligently or punctually, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jonathan</hi> did manife≈øt his diligence to ob≈øerve the punctual time, as it is evident, becau≈øe he went out into the field on the third day in the Morning, which (≈øaith the Text) was <hi>at the time appointed with David,</hi> v. 35.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:36425:22"/>Object, 4. <hi>How can you make</hi> Jonathans <hi>Morning to be the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time with</hi> David, <hi>≈øeeing</hi> David <hi>did not appoint</hi> Jonathan <hi>to meet him on the third day in the morning, but on the third day at even, as</hi> v. 5. <hi>te≈øtifieth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈øw. Jonathans</hi> morning was the appointed time with <hi>David,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>Jonathans</hi> morning did end at mid-day, and <hi>Davids</hi> evening did begin at mid-day, at the fir≈øt declining of the Sun: now <hi>Jonathan</hi> could not have come quickly, diligently, exactly and punctually to the place appointed at the beginning of the evening, unle≈ø≈øe he went out on the third day morning, that is to ≈øay, a little before the evening began; but by his diligence in taking in a little peece of the morning at the beginning of his Journey, he might well be at the place appointed according to the punctuall time of the appointed Evening; and thus <hi>Jonathans</hi> Morning and <hi>Davids</hi> Evening do meet together at Mid-day, and no other re≈øolution can be given, as I conceive, to make <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> morning and <hi>Davids</hi> evening to agree together at one and the ≈øame appointed time but this.</p>
                  <p>Object. 5. <hi>Why may not the appointed evening be under≈øtood of the night-evening, and the appointed place be a great way off, and in that re≈øpect</hi> Jonathan <hi>might begin his journey in the morning, that ≈øo he might come to the place appointed at the time of the Sun-≈øet evening?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I perceive that men are loath to have any other evening, but the night-evening, and therefore they are willing to rai≈øe what Objections they can again≈øt the mid-day evening: But I will give you divers Rea≈øons why the appointed evening cannot be meant of the Sun-≈øet evening.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, If the place of meeting had been ≈øo far off as to cau≈øe <hi>Jonathan</hi> to ≈øpend ≈øo much time in going thither as from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till Sun-≈øet, then <hi>Jonathan</hi> could not have had time enough left to return back again into the City in the ≈øame day. But the Text in ver. 23. doth tell us that <hi>Jonathan</hi> did return the ≈øame day into the City; therefore the appointed evening cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood of the ≈øun-≈øet evening.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Jonathan</hi> returned alone without any company with him, for he had ≈øent his Boy back into the City before, which in rea≈øon he would not have done, if the place of meeting had been ≈øo far off as you make it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:36425:22"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Jonathan</hi> knew that <hi>Saul</hi> was jealous of his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with <hi>David,</hi> and he knew al≈øo that <hi>Saul</hi> was much inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged again≈øt <hi>David</hi> at this time; Therefore in wi≈ødom <hi>Jonathan</hi> would not be ≈øo long ab≈øent from <hi>Saul</hi> as from morning till Sun-≈øet; nay, it would have been Mid-night ere he could have returned, if the place appointed to meet at had been ≈øo far off as you would make it, and then <hi>Soul</hi> might well have ≈øu≈øpected that <hi>Jonathan</hi> might have had ≈øome other errand into the field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides ≈øhooting at a mark, by his long and late ab≈øence; but <hi>Ionathan</hi> pretended no other errand but to ≈øhoot at a mark, and therefore he took his Boy with him to witne≈ø≈øe ≈øo much if need ≈øhould be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence it followes, that the place of meeting was but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way without the City; for what need had a man goe farre to ≈øhoot at a Mark? and ≈øo it asked but a little time to goe to it, and to return from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hence it followes, that the appointed Evening mu≈øt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood of the Mid-day Evening, and not of the Sun-≈øet Evening: And thus <hi>Jonathans</hi> Morning and <hi>Davids</hi> Evening did fitly agree to the ≈øame appointed hour at Mid-day.</p>
                  <p>In like ≈øort one Evangeli≈øt ≈øaith that Chri≈øt was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the third houre, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. 25. But <hi>John</hi> ≈øaith he was crucified at the ≈øixt hour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 14. this differing relation of time, may ≈øeem to have as great a difference as is between <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans</hi> Morning and <hi>Davids</hi> Evening, and yet there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all when things come to be rightly expounded: For the Jewes divided the Artificiall Day into four great Hours, ju≈øt as they divided the Night into four great Watches, <hi>Mark.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Jews di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the day into four great hours, as they divided the night into four watches.</note> 13. 35. every great hour contained in it three ≈ømall houres; The fir≈øt great hour they called by the name of the third hour, becau≈øe it ended with the third ≈ømall hour, which we call nine a clock; and their ≈øecond great hour they called their ≈øixt, becau≈øe it ended with the ≈øixt ≈ømall hour, which we call twelve a clock; and thus as ≈øoon as the fir≈øt great hour ended with our nine a clock, the ≈øecond great hour began with our ten a clock: And thus <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in the <hi>Judges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Godwin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weames,</hi> do accord the≈øe great hours with our ≈ømall hours, and ju≈øt after this ≈øort the end of <hi>Jonathans</hi> Morning in v. 35. and the beginnings of <hi>Davids</hi> Evening in v. 5. do fitly clo≈øe and meet together at Mid-day.</p>

Fifthly, I prove that the naturall Evening doth begin at Mid-day, by <hi>Jo≈øh.</hi> 7. 6. There <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> and the Elders fell down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth before the Ark of the Lord till Even-tide, that is to ≈øay until Evening began.</p>

But <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> could not ≈øanctifie them at the Sun-≈øet Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for then the day of their cleanne≈ø≈øe mu≈øt begin, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law; they mu≈øt therefore be wa≈øhed from their defilements in the afternoon, or el≈øe they could not begin the day of their cleanne≈ø≈øe at their Sun-≈øet Evening; and in ca≈øe they did not begin the new day of their cleanne≈ø≈øe at Sun-≈øet, they might not come before the Lords Arke on the morrow to beg Attonement for Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors, as I have opened the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more at large in Chap. 4.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> could not have ≈øanctified the people in a fit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to come before the Lords Ark on the morrow, if he had lain ≈øtill upon the earth till the Even-tide at Sun-≈øet; for <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> mu≈øt have a large time to inform all the people by a Proclamation through all the Camp, what was the cau≈øe of the Lords anger, and what they mu≈øt do by way of preparation before they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Lords favour<hi>:</hi> The thing they mu≈øt do by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was to ≈øanctifie them≈øelves from their Ceremonial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, by wa≈øhing their Bodies and their Cloaths according to the Ceremonial cu≈øtoms, as they are ≈øet down in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2. and this mu≈øt be done in the ≈øame Even-tide wherein the Lord ≈øpake to <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> and to the Elders, ≈øaying, <hi>

Sixthly, I prove, That the full naturall Evening begins at Mid-day when the Afternoon begins, becau≈øe the Evening in Scripture is often put for the Afternoon, as the morning is put for the Forenoon: <hi>In the morning ≈øow thy ≈øeed, and in the Evening let not thy hand re≈øt, Eccle≈ø.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Solomons</hi> meaning is, that men ≈øhould be as diligent in doing good at all times, as the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in ≈øeed-time; he will not re≈øt from ≈øowing his ≈øeed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forenoon nor afternoon, becau≈øe he knows not which will prove be≈øt. A wi≈øe and diligent Husband-man will go out to ≈øow his ≈øeed in the afternoon Evening, and not defer it till the Sun-≈øet Evening; therefore by <hi>Solomons</hi> account the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the Afternoon at Mid-day.</p>
                  <p>2. It is ≈øaid <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 90. 6. <hi>In the morning the gra≈ø≈øe flouri≈øheth and groweth up, but in the evening it is cut down and withereth:</hi> The Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman doth not u≈øe to go out to mow his gra≈ø≈øe in the evening after Sun-≈øet, or if he ≈øometimes do ≈øo, yet it doth not wither in the evening after Sun-≈øet; But Husbandmen u≈øe to take the opportunity to mow their gra≈ø≈øe in the afternoon, and then it withereth, therefore the Evening begins with the afternoon.</p>
                  <p>3. It is ≈øaid in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 16. that <hi>Goliah</hi> drew near Morning and Evening forty days together<hi>:</hi> But Souldiers doe not u≈øe to call for a Pitched Battle in the evening after Sun-≈øet, but either in the Forenoon or in the Afternoon Evening.</p>
                  <p>4. It is ≈øaid 1 <hi>King</hi> 17. 6. That the Ravens brought bread and fle≈øh to <hi>Elijah</hi> morning and evening: but the Ravens do not u≈øe to carry meat in the evening after Sun-≈øet, for then they u≈øe to flie to their Roo≈øt, and ≈øo to continue there all night; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ravens carried meat to <hi>Elijah</hi> in the Afternoon Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øent for the Jews in <hi>Rome</hi> to come to his Iodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he might te≈øtifie unto them the things of the Kingdome of God, and that he might per≈øwade them concerning Je≈øus, and they came at the day appointed, and then <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto them from morning till evening, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 23. But I think no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate man will ≈øay that <hi>Paul</hi> continued his Sermon to that mixed multitude from the morning light, till the evening at Sun-≈øet: The hungry bellies and captious ≈øpirits of mo≈øt of the≈øe Jewes would not indure it; neither would <hi>Pauls</hi> wi≈ødom nor

his ≈øtrength ≈øuffer him to offer it, e≈øpecially ≈øeeing the Jewes of this Synagogue had before-hand manife≈øted to <hi>Paul</hi> their di≈ølike of this Sect, ver≈ø. 22.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe circum≈øtances con≈øidered, this phra≈øe from morning till evening mu≈øt be under≈øtood of a convenient portion of time for one Sermon. It is like they came to <hi>Pauls</hi> lodging at the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary houre wherein they u≈øed to re≈øort to their Synagogues, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine a clock in the morning, and it is like al≈øo that <hi>Paul</hi> continued his Sermon to them till the Noon-tide evening, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more or le≈ø≈øe, as in wi≈ødom he thought it convenient, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances con≈øidered, and in likelihood the Jews would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point to meet at <hi>Pauls</hi> lodging before the ordinary hour of morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer, nor be contented to ≈øtay longer than Dinner-time, when the Evening begins, at Mid-day; therefore it may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by probable conjecture, that the evening began at Mid-day in <hi>Rome</hi> as well as in <hi>Iudea.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. 4. <hi>Bring a De≈øcription of the twofold Divi≈øion of the fir≈øt Naturall Day, how and in what order every part of it was ≈øhaped, named and framed together.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe fir≈øt Natural day in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5, was twice divided by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> ju≈øt according to the Lines of Longitude and Latitude in the Globe, and it was ≈øhaped and framed together in this order.</p>
                  <p>Take a peece of paper and pourtray upon it the ≈øhape or image of a compa≈ø≈øe Dial. Then fir≈øt ≈øhadow out upon it the fir≈øt darkne≈øs from the North point almo≈øt to the Ea≈øt point.</p>
                  <p>2. Then ≈øhadow out a little peece of Twilight to fill it up to the Ea≈øt point, as a ≈øign that the light did thence break out of darkne≈ø≈øe by degrees.</p>
                  <p>3. Then ≈øhadow out a peece of light of ≈øix hours long, for the a≈øcending of the ≈øhining light from the Ea≈øt point to the South point.</p>
                  <p>4. Then make a mark of di≈øtinction at the South point for the ≈øtanding ≈øtill of the light for a little while at Mid-day.</p>
                  <p>5. Then ≈øhadow out another peece of light of ≈øix hours long for the declining of the light from the South point to the We≈øt point.</p>
                  <p>6 Then write upon all this ≈øhining light from the Ea≈øt point to the We≈øt point, the name Day, as the proper name of his perfect ≈øhape and limit; and in this order was the fir≈øt Artificiall Day ≈øhaped out, limited, and named.</p>
                  <p>7. Then ≈øhadow out a little peece of Twilight, at the departure of the light out of that Horizon, on the in≈øide of the We≈øt point.</p>
                  <p>8. Then take twelve hours darkne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øhadow out the fir≈øt half of that Darkne≈ø≈øe from the We≈øt point untill it meet with the place of the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe at the North point.</p>
                  <p>9. Then write upon all that Darkne≈ø≈øe from the We≈øt point to the Ea≈øt point, the name Night, as the proper name of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ≈øhape and limit, and in this order was the night la≈øt ≈øhaped out, limited and named. Then let the other half of the la≈øt twelve hours Darkne≈ø≈øe be ≈øet upon the out-≈øide of the ≈øame Compa≈ø≈øe Diall, from the North point to the Ea≈øt point, for the beginning of the ≈øecond Day.</p>

10. Hence we may ob≈øerve the Rea≈øon why the fir≈øt Darknes could not be called Night at fir≈øt, namely, becau≈øe it wanted the form and limits of a Night, for it wanted the ≈øhape of a twilight going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and therefore until it had obtained that, it was called no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe but confu≈øed darknes, and it could not have this form til the la≈øt period of time belonging to the night was fini≈øhed; and it could not have that period till the fir≈øt half of that twelve houres darkne≈ø≈øe ≈øucceeding the Artificial Day had met with the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe at the North point, and that conjunction occa≈øioned a mark of di≈øtinction in the middle of the night.</p>
                  <p>11. By the≈øe marks of di≈øtinction, the true Form and Figure of the two Lines of Longitude and Latitude, from Ea≈øt to We≈øt, and from North to South, were clearly marked out.</p>
                  <p>12. By this Line of divi≈øion from Mid-day to Mid-night the Natural Day was again divided into two equal parts (in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner from the divi≈øion of the Day from the Night) the fir≈øt half from Mid-day to Mid-night was called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, and the other half from Mid-night to Mid-day was called <hi>Boker,</hi> the Morning,</p>
                  <p>13. After this ≈øort hath the God of Nature halfed and quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Natural day by the Lines of Longitude and Latitude.</p>
                  <p>14 By this method the God of Nature hath not only made the natural day to be a twiparty day, con≈øi≈øting of light, and darkne≈øs; But al≈øo Secondly, He hath made the Artificial Day to be a twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party day, becau≈øe he hath made the one half of it to belong unto the Morning, and the other half of it to belong unto the Evening. Thirdly, He hath al≈øo made the Night to be a twiparty Night, becau≈øe he hath made the one half of it to belong unto the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the other half of it to belong unto the morning. And in this regard the night is ≈øometimes called nights in the plural number, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 134. 1. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 92. 2. Fourthly, He hath al≈øo made the Natural Evening to be a twiparty evening, becau≈øe it is a connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the latter half of the Day, to the fir≈øt half of the Night; and in this re≈øpect it is called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> a connexion, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is called <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> the two Evenings, becau≈øe of the two parts of it. Fifthly, He hath al≈øo made the Natural Morning to be a twiparty Morning, becau≈øe it is a connexion of the fir≈øt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, or of the latter half of the night, with the fir≈øt half of the Artificial day, and in this re≈øpect it is often called Mornings in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36425:26"/>
plural number, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 73. 14. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 101. 8. <hi>Job</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>I≈ø.</hi> 33. 2.</p>
                  <p>15. The Rea≈øon why the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe could not be called either <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning, or <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, at fir≈øt, was, becau≈øe the≈øe names are names of the perfect ≈øhape and limits given unto the≈øe two parts of the Natural day; and the fir≈øt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe was a confu≈øed mi≈ø-≈øhapen thing at fir≈øt, therefore it could not belong either unto the Morning or unto the Evening, until it was fir≈øt ≈øhaped and limited into a night; for <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning is con≈øtituted of a part of the ≈øhaped Night, as well as of a part of the ≈øhaped Artificial Day; and the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe could not be ≈øhaped into a Night until it had twelve houres darkne≈ø≈øe ≈øuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Artificial Day, by means whereof the fir≈øt half had a Twilight going before it, and then as ≈øoon as it met with the fir≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe at the North point, it Fir≈øt gave perfection of ≈øhape to the Night. And Secondly, It gave perfection of ≈øhape to the Evening. And thirdly, It gave perfection of ≈øhape to <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly, every part of this day had its name as ≈øoon as it had its perfect ≈øhape; as for example, when the ≈øhining light had fini≈øhed its la≈øt period at the We≈øt point, it was called Day; in like ≈øort, when the darkne≈ø≈øe had fini≈øhed its la≈øt period at the North point, it was called Night: And then al≈øo the Evening and the Morning was the Fir≈øt Day.</p>

                     <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I ≈øee no Rea≈øon to re≈øtrain the ≈øignification of <hi>Boker</hi> to mans ≈øeeking by the ≈øight of his eyes, in the time of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Morning onely, but con≈øidering that <hi>Boker,</hi> the Morning, is placed among the works of Gods Creation before man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it may be con≈øidered as Gods fir≈øt early time in ordering the Creation in the be≈øt manner; for God may be ≈øaid to ≈øeek early (after the manner of men) not for want of knowledge in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but to ≈øet out his Wi≈ødom and Prudence, and Fatherly care, and the like, in the fir≈øt Creation, as the≈øe Scriptures do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 24. 27. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 11, 12, 16. <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 90. 14. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119. 176. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>by Wi≈ødom the Lord founded the Earth, and by <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtanding he e≈øtabli≈øhed the Heavens, Prov.</hi> 3. 19. and ≈øo by Wi≈ødom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding he formed all the parts of the Fir≈øt Day, in ≈øuch an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite Order, that ≈øo it might be for an exemplary pattern to all the other Natural daies to the end of the world. Secondly, Early ≈øeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be done by advice, coun≈øel, and meditation, as well in the time of darkne≈ø≈øe, as in the morning light. Thirdly, When it plea≈øed the Lord to uncreat <hi>Judah</hi> by his de≈øtroying Judgements (namely, by wars from the Enemy) how did God order it to be done? but by his early looking out and ≈øearching into things; For thus ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>I looked upon the Earth, and loe it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form and void, and to the Heavens, and they had no light,</hi> Jer. 4. 23. for by their wicked confu≈øed Government they had provoked the Lord by wars to turn all their Commonwealth into a Chaos a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. This form of ≈øpeech (by contraries) declares that God by his wi≈øe Providence did ≈øearch out in the time of the fir≈øt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs how to adorn the earth with light, and how to order all the parts of the fir≈øt day in the be≈øt manner, and in this re≈øpect Gods early Providence is often ≈øet out by the term Morning, both in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36425:27"/>
regard of his early Judgements upon a people, and al≈øo in regard <note place="margin">Boker, the Morning, is put for Gods early ≈øeeking either to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or protect the godly.</note> of his early Pre≈øervation of his own people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His early and ≈øpeedy Judgements upon the wicked are ≈øet out by the term Morning, in <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 73. 14 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 7, 10. and ≈øo in <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 10. 15.

                  <p n="2">2. The term Morning doth often denote Gods early care and Providence in looking out for the Protection of his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 24. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 46. 7.</p>
                  <p>Hence I infer, that ≈øeeing the word Morning doth ≈øignifie early ≈øeeking, or early looking out, it may well denote unto us, that the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs was not comprehended under the term Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but under the term Morning, for <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put for early or fir≈øt, but it is always put for late or la≈øt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it was the latter part of the Day, as I have ≈øhewed in my An≈øwer to the third Objection of the former Chapter, and more by and by.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is further evident that the Morning time was fir≈øt, <note place="margin">As Gnereb the Evening is put for la≈øt time<hi>:</hi> So Boker the Morning is put for the fir≈øt time, or for the beginning of a thing.</note> and the Evening la≈øt, by <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 27. <hi>Benjamin ≈øhall ravine like a Woolf, in the Morning he ≈øhall devour the prey, and in the Evening he ≈øhall divide the ≈øpoile;</hi> The Seventy render it, <hi>The early Morning;</hi> and truly, ≈øeeing the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs had the priority of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Artificial Morning, it is not proper to put the Artificial Morning for fir≈øt in preheminence of time before the fir≈øt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and therefore in rea≈øon, the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs mu≈øt belong to the early Morning, as well as the fir≈øt half of the Artificial Day doth, or el≈øe <hi>Jacob</hi> did not make a proper Allu≈øion to the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and to the Evening, if the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs had been Evening, for then the evening had been fir≈øt in order of time; ≈øearch into the ≈øtory of Events, and ≈øee how <hi>Jacobs</hi> Prophecie doth relate to the term Morning and Evening; the event of his P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

2. In the Evening-time of the world God rai≈øed up <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> to divide the ≈øpoil with the other Apo≈øtles, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Go≈øpel, for <hi>Paul</hi> is ≈øaid to make the Word of God to abound from <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> to <hi>Illyricum, Rom.</hi> 15. 19. and it is further evident that the daies of the Go≈øpel are called the Evening, by <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 7. the Prophet doth there foretel that there ≈øhall be a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Jews (namely of the di≈øper≈øed Jews dwelling in ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countries) that ≈øhall be called to re≈øt or lie down in the Evening, and to this remnant of di≈øper≈øed Jewes did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James</hi> write in the Evening-time of the Go≈øpel to exhort them to re≈øt and repo≈øe their Souls in Chri≈øt for Life and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zachary</hi> al≈øo doth u≈øe the term Evening for the la≈øt times, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the daies of the Go≈øpel, and in that re≈øpect the time of the Go≈øpel is often called the la≈øt dayes, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. 20. <hi>Zacharies</hi> phra≈øe runs thus, <hi>In the Evening time it ≈øhall be light, Zach.</hi> 14. 7. It is very ≈øuitable to compare the la≈øt daies of the Go≈øpel to the Evening, becau≈øe it is the la≈øt half of the Natural Day; and it is mo≈øt ≈øuitable al≈øo to compare the light of the Go≈øpel to the light of the Evening, for the Evening begins at Mid-day at the fir≈øt declining of the Sun, and then the day is mo≈øt clear and bright, and ≈øo it continues till almo≈øt Sun-≈øet; and in the la≈øt days, when the Apo≈øtles had a Commi≈ø≈øion to preach the Go≈øpel in all the world, the Go≈øpel gave a light mo≈øt clear to many ≈øouls that ≈øat in darkne≈øs: But if the Evening had been no other time but the dark Night, as the mo≈øt would have it, then <hi>Zacharies</hi> Allu≈øion to the light of that Evening, had been but a poor compari≈øon to ≈øet forth the light of the Go≈øpel, for in ≈øuch an Evening there is no other light but Star-light, or Moon-light at the be≈øt, and that is but a poor light to illu≈øtrate the light of the Go≈øpel by, in the days of the Apo≈øtles.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the Evening is often put for la≈øt, ≈øo the Morning is put for fir≈øt, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>The man Gabriel whom I had ≈øeen in a vi≈øion at Fir≈øt,</hi> or in the Morning, ≈øo the Hebrew ≈øpeaks.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is evident by another Allu≈øion that the Morning is before the Evening, becau≈øe the term Morning is put for the very fir≈øt beginning of a thing; and in this ≈øen≈øe <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> is mo≈øt elegant, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 47. 11. Evill ≈øhall come upon thee (O <hi>Babylon)</hi> and thou ≈øhalt not know the morning thereof (or the beginning thereof.) The Hebrew word ≈øignifies the early Morning; but the

                     <hi>Geneva</hi> doth render it the Beginning; and by this phra≈øe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gho≈øt did (by a Periphra≈øis) de≈øcribe the beginning of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> ruin by the early Morning.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>Good Divines do take the term Morning here for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Artificial Day, and the word Morning in that ≈øen≈øe doth not hinder, but that the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs was Evening.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I have already an≈øwered this Objection immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I told you there, that if the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs had been called Evening, then doubtle≈øs the Evening would have been put for the fir≈øt beginning of any thing, and the Morning for la≈øt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Morning is put for the fir≈øt beginning of a thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is out of all doubt to me, that the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs did belong to the Morning and not to the Evening.</p>
                  <p>2. I an≈øwer further, that the Morning of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall cannot be ≈øo conveniently compared to the Morning of the Artificial day, as to the dark early morning; becau≈øe the Artificial Morning is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and per≈øpicuous to all men: But the ruin of <hi>Babylon</hi> was not per≈øpicuous at fir≈øt, but it was carryed on in a ≈øpeedy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcure manner by the <hi>Per≈øians,</hi> ≈øo that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had no ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition or di≈øcerning of their fall as yet; therefore the Morning of the Artificial Day was not ≈øo ≈øuitable to exemplifie the manner of their ≈øpeedy ruin, as the early dark Morning was, for it was done ≈øpeedily ere they were aware, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 24. as it appears by the≈øe two con≈øiderations.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Put both the≈øe Prophetical allu≈øions together, and then they wil amount to thus much, that <hi>Babylon</hi> ≈øhould be de≈øtroyed in that Morning, that begins in the Night; and the Hi≈øtory of Events doth tell us, not onely that <hi>Bel≈øhazzer</hi> was ≈ølain in the Night, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 30. but al≈øo it is apparent by the circum≈øtances of time that mu≈øt be ≈øpent at that drunken fea≈øt before that <hi>Daniel</hi> could be ≈øought out and brought in, to interpret the vi≈øion, that it was in the latter part of the Night, after the Morning was begun.</p>
                  <p>Take the early Morning of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall either in the former fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative ≈øen≈øe, or in the la≈øt proper ≈øen≈øe (either way or both wayes) and it doth ≈øufficiently prove, that the time called Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36425:29"/>
was fir≈øt in order before the time called Evening, or el≈øe this Allu≈øion of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall to the early Morning had been improper; hence it follows, that the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs was comprehended under the term Morning, and not under the term Evening.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning, is put for the fir≈øt beginning of a <note place="margin">Fifthly, Boker, the morning, is put for the Sun-≈øet Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becau≈øe the time of Sun-≈øet is the fir≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Jews day of eleanne≈øles.</note> thing, becau≈øe it is put for the fir≈øt beginning of the Jews Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial day (or for the Sun-≈øet Evening) as the Hebrew Doctors do witne≈øs.

This I have further opened in another place; and ≈øo in like ≈øort <hi>Macar,</hi> the morrow, is put for the fir≈øt beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day (or for the Sun-≈øet Evening) in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15. as it is further opened in chap. 4.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It is evident that the morning was before the time called Evening by the title that <hi>Job</hi> gives to the Angels, he cals them <hi>Morning-Stars, Job</hi> 38. 6, 7. The≈øe Morning-Stars cannot be meant of the Stars in the Firmament, for they were not created till the fourth day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. But the≈øe Morning-Stars are ≈øaid to ≈øhout and ≈øing when the foundation of the earth was laid; Hence it follows, that the Angels are called Morning-Stars, either becau≈øe of the time wherein they ≈øhouted at the fir≈øt laying of the foundations of the earth, which was done in the time of the fir≈øt darkne≈øs, or el≈øe in relation to the time of their Creation, which was al≈øo done in the time of the fir≈øt darkne≈øs, as many learned do accord.</p>
                  <p>But if the time of their Creation, or the time wherein they ≈øhouted at the laying of the foundations of the earth had been Evening, then the Angels ≈øhould more properly have been called Evening-Stars, than Morning-Stars.</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. <hi>The Angels are called Morning-Stars, not in relation to the time of their Creation, but by way of allu≈øion to the excellency of their Nature, and this is more ≈øuitable to be expre≈ø≈øed by the light of the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial morning, than by the fir≈øt darkne≈øs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈øw.</hi> If the Circum≈øtances of Gods di≈øcour≈øe with <hi>Job,</hi> and of Gods Interrogations be well marked, there is no ground to ≈øay that God did onely intend to ≈øet out the excellent nature of the Angels by comparing them to the morning of the Artificiall day.</p>
                  <p>For the main thing that God aimed at by his Interrogations to <hi>Job,</hi> was, to make him ≈øee his folly in de≈øiring to di≈øpute the cau≈øe of his afflictions with God, God ≈øhews him that he is not able to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36425:29"/>
find out the depths of his Wi≈ødom in the fir≈øt laying of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the earth, becau≈øe it made the Angels to ≈øhout out with admiration, and therefore <hi>Job</hi> was much le≈øs able to ≈øearch out the rea≈øon of his dealings with him, in his pre≈øent afflictions, and in that re≈øpect God did po≈øe him with this Interrogation, <hi>Where wa≈øt thou when I laid the foundation of the earth, tell, if thou have under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Job 38. 4, 5, 6. <hi>When the morning Stars rejoyced together, and when the Sons of God ≈øhouted,</hi> Ver. 7. The Text doth plainly call them Morning Stars, not ≈øo much in regard of the excellency of their Nature, but in regard of the time wherein they were created, or wherein they ≈øhouted at the excellency of Gods Workman≈øhip when the foundation of the earth was laid, either way or both waies do a≈ø≈øure us that the time of the fir≈øt darkne≈øs was called Morning and not Evening. And that is the thing that I aim at in this fir≈øt Section of this Chapter.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 2. <hi>Proving that the Morning doth begin in the dark Night.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>FIr≈øt, No man can deny but that the Morning is begun when the morning Watch is begun, for the text doth affirm it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 24. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 11. And it is a known thing, that among the Jews they did alwaies begin it ju≈øt three hours after Midnight, not onely in the Summer time but al≈øo in the Winter time: Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that their morning Watch in the time of Winter mu≈øt needs begin in the dark night, not onely in <hi>Judea,</hi> but al≈øo in all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable parts of the world.</p>
                  <p>2. Hence it follows, that ≈øeeing the morning Watch did begin at three hours after Mid-night, then it will follow, that it mu≈øt end ju≈øt three hours after Mid-day; for in common rea≈øon the morning mu≈øt be as long as the evening, namely, twelve hours long, or el≈øe the Evening may better be called an Unevening, then an Evening to the Morning; but none that have their ≈øen≈øes will ≈øay that the morning doth continue till three hours after Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
                  <p>3 Hence it follows, that it is more agreeable to Scripture and to common rea≈øon to begin the natural morning at the marked time of Mid-night, rather than three hours after, e≈øpecially ≈øeeing it is then as dark all the winter long as it is at Mid-night, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36425:30"/>
therefore ≈øeeing the morning is begun with darkne≈øs, why not with darkne≈øs at mid-night, as well as at three hours after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, ≈øeeing the world was created in the Equinoctial, and the Morning is then as dark at three hours after Mid-night, as it is at Mid-night?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Ruth</hi> lay at the feet of <hi>Boaz</hi> until the Morning, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 3. 14. and yet ≈øhe aro≈øe before one could know another. Hence it is evident that it was Morning in the time of Barly Harve≈øt, whiles it was yet dark; it may be it was now in the end of our <hi>March,</hi> or in the beginning of our <hi>April;</hi> and though ≈øome ≈øay that the Morning Watch was not ≈øo called from the fir≈øt hour of it, but from the la≈øt hour of it when it begun to be day light; yet this place of <hi>Ruth</hi> cals it Morning whiles it was yet dark, and before one could know another.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is ≈øaid that Chri≈øt aro≈øe in the Morning <hi>a great while before Day</hi> (or greatly in the Night) ≈øo the Greek ≈øpeaks, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 35. Hence it is manife≈øt that it was Morning, whiles it was greatly or much in the night.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, None can deny but that the morning is begun at the time of day-break in all the Inhabited Countries of the world. Hence it follows, that then it is morning in ≈øome Countries near unto mid-night, e≈øpecially when the daies are at the longe≈øt; and known experience doth tell us that in the North parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the day doth ≈øometimes begin to break near unto mid-night; and indeed the day-light (when the daies are at the longe≈øt) is ≈øcar≈øe ever out of the Sky in tho≈øe parts, except a little while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mid-night; Hence it follows, that ≈øeeing it is day-break ≈øometimes near unto Mid-night, then why may not the morning begin at mid-night all the year long as well in one Country as in another, ≈øeeing the God of Nature hath ≈øet ≈øuch an eminent mark upon mid-night, and upon mid-day, which doubtle≈øs was to ≈øet out the bounds and limits of the Natural morning, and of the evening?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Both Scripture and experience doth tell us that there is a certain Star called the Morning Star, which at ≈øome time of the year is ≈øeen to ari≈øe not long after Mid-night, and all men call it morning as ≈øoon as that Star is ri≈øen, and in ≈øome parts when the daies are at the longe≈øt it ri≈øeth near unto Mid-night, but it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ri≈øeth before it is day break.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>FIr≈øt, I will endeavor to prove that the morning doth begin at mid-night by an argument drawn from <hi>Job</hi> 26. 7. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Job</hi> ≈øaith, That <hi>God ≈øtretcheth out the North upon the empty;</hi> and ≈øaith <hi>Mo≈øes, The Earth was empty and void,</hi> namely, as long as darkne≈øs was upon the face of the deep; But as ≈øoon as the light was created, the earth could not be ≈øaid to be empty and void any longer, for then the deep was adorned with the light as with a mo≈øt glorious ornament.</p>
                  <p>Object. 4. <hi>The fir≈øt Darkne≈øs did continue twelve hours upon the face of the deep, after the general matter called Earth was created: Or thus, how long was the Earth empty and void before the light was created?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The an≈øwer is from <hi>Job,</hi> That the Earth was empty and void all the ≈øpace of time that the North point is ≈øtretched out upon a Compa≈øs Dial, namely, the ≈øpace of ≈øix hours, for the North point on a Compa≈øs Dial doth ≈øtretch it ≈øelf out untill it meet with the beginning of the Ea≈øt point, the four ends of the two Lines of Longitude and Latitude do make the four Cardinal Points of the Compa≈øs, North, Ea≈øt, South, and We≈øt: Hence it follows, that the North point is ≈øtretched out to the Ea≈øt point, and that is ju≈øt ≈øix hours by the Compa≈øs Dyal, and ≈øo long ≈øaith <hi>Job</hi> the Globe was empty; but as ≈øoon as God created Light out of Darkne≈øs, which began to appear by degrees, fir≈øt, By a Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and then ≈øhined forth at the Ea≈øt point, then the Earth was no longer empty and void, but it was adorued with the light.</p>
                  <p>If any man can give a better Interpretation, for the ≈øtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the North upon the Empty, I ≈øhall bee glad to ≈øee it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:36425:31"/>
But if the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs had been twelve hours long, then <hi>Job</hi> ≈øhould have ≈øaid, that God ≈øtretched out the We≈øt point, as well as the North point upon the Empty: but <hi>Job</hi> doth not ≈øay ≈øo, but only that he ≈øtretched out the North upon the Empty, and therefore it follows,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That the fir≈øt Darkne≈øs was not twelve hours, but only ≈øix hours long upon the face of the deep, before the light was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hence it follows, that the fir≈øt half of that twelve hours Darkne≈øs that ≈øucceeded the Artificial Day, did make up the fir≈øt darkne≈øs to be a ju≈øt Night of twelve hours, and after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both the≈øe parts of Darkne≈øs did meet together at the North point, as I have exemplified the matter upon a Compa≈øs Dyal, and the North Land in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 8. may according to the Hebrew be read from the Land of darkne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>And why el≈øe doth the Prophet in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 89. 12. begin the time of the fir≈øt Creation in order from the North point, but to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us, where, and how long the darkne≈øs did continue upon the face of the deep after the Earth was created, before the light was created?</p>
                  <p>And ≈øo likewi≈øe for this Rea≈øon, <hi>Job</hi> doth teach us in what order we mu≈øt place the four ends of the two Lines of Latitude and Longitude (now called the foure Cardinall Points of the Compa≈øs) by placing a man in this order to view the Globe.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 He calleth the North point, the left hand.</item>
                     <item>2 He calleth the South point, the right hand.</item>
                     <item>3 He calleth the Ea≈øt point, before.</item>
                     <item>4 He calleth the We≈øt point, behind. See <hi>Tremelius</hi> for this in <hi>Job</hi> 23. 89.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>So then, He that de≈øires to behold the Globe in a right order, how the God of Nature did divide it and quarter it, mu≈øt place the North point of the Globe at his left hand, the Ea≈øt before, the South at his right hand, and the We≈øt behind. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 89. 13. and in <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. 3, 29.</p>
                  <p>2 The holy Scriptures do often direct us to ob≈øerve the foure ends of the two Lines of Latitude and Longitude.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>And in this re≈øpect the four quarters of the Earth are ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36425:32"/>
called the four wings, or the four corners of the Earth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Job</hi> 37. 3. and 38. 13.</p>
                  <p>2 The Heavens are divided into four quarters, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect the four Winds are ≈øaid to come from the four quarters of Heaven, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49. 36. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 2. and 8. 2. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31.</p>
                  <p>And when the Lines of Latitude and Longitude are drawn upon a Compa≈øs Dyal or upon a Globe, then they make the four winds in the four quarters of Heaven to lie thus, and to be called thus, North-Ea≈øt, South-Ea≈øt, South-we≈øt, North-we≈øt.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Holy Scripture doth force us to ob≈øerve the various u≈øe of the≈øe two Lines of Longitude and Latitude; and therefore doubtle≈øs <hi>Job</hi> was not ignorant, but ≈øpake as a man of knowledge, when he ≈øaid that God ≈øtretched out the North up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Empty. Fir≈øt, He was not ignorant of the North point. Nor ≈øecondly, How far it ≈øtretched. Nor thirdly, of the time of the Globes emptine≈øs.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth direct us to take notice of the North point as the fir≈øt in order of the ≈øour Cardinal points, becau≈øe he doth fir≈øt begin the divi≈øion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> from the North quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ≈øo he ends it with the We≈øt quarter, read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. from ver. 15. to the end of the Chapter; and in this order al≈øo the Lord was plea≈øed to let <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> take a view of the land, he ≈øtood in the Land of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and from thence in the fir≈øt place he viewed <hi>Dan</hi> which was the furthe≈øt Northward and Northally in <hi>Galilee,</hi> which lay al≈øo Northward. Secondly, Then he viewed the land of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and half <hi>Mana≈ø≈øeh</hi> which lay Ea≈øtward from him in the middle of the Land. Thirdly, Then he viewed the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> to the South. And fourthly, Then he viewed the Land of <hi>Jerico</hi> which lay in the We≈øt of <hi>Canaan.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will indeavor to prove that the Morning began with the fir≈øt darkne≈øs, and that the fir≈øt darkne≈øs mu≈øt be placed at the North point by another phra≈øe of <hi>Job,</hi> for <hi>Job</hi> doth tell us that when the winds have purged the Air, and made it clear from clouds and vapours, that then out of the North a golden light doth ≈øhew it ≈øelf, <hi>Job</hi> 37. 22. Our eie-≈øight may witne≈øs the truth of this point, for in a clear Morning before Sun-ri≈øing we may often ≈øee a golden li≈øt of light ≈øtretching it ≈øelf from the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36425:32"/>
North point to the Ea≈øt; and again after Sun-≈øet we may often ≈øee a golden li≈øt of light ≈øtretching it ≈øelf from the We≈øt point to the North point. This Ob≈øervation, Fir≈øt, Of the golden li≈øt from North to Ea≈øt, may teach us that the root of the Morning comes from the North point, where the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night begins by the Compa≈øs-Dyall. And Secondly, The gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den li≈øt in the Evening after Sun-≈øet from We≈øt to North, may teach us that the Evening doth reach unto Mid-night, or to the North point.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I prove that the Natural Morning doth being at Mid-night, becau≈øe the morning of the fifteenth day of <hi>Ni≈øhan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at Mid-night.</p>
                  <p>I collect it thus, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> at the fir≈øt pa≈ø≈øeover in <hi>Egypt</hi> gave a very ≈øtrict charge to all the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> that no man ≈øhould go out of the door of his hou≈øe untill the Morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 22. name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not untill the morning of the fifteenth day was come; this was <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> expre≈øs charge. Hence I rea≈øon thus, if any man of <hi>I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had gone out of the door of his hou≈øe before the morning of the fifteenth day was truely come, contrary to this charge (as tho≈øe did that went out of the door of their hou≈øes to gather Manna on the Sabbath-day morning) they would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors for it (as they were that gathered Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na on the Sabbath day morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 27. 28.)</p>
                  <p>But all the people of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> went out of the doors of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes either at Mid-night or pre≈øently after, as it appears by ver. 33. and 39. and yet none of them were condemned as tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors for it: But on the contrary, their exact obedience to all <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> commands is twice over te≈øtified in ver. 28. and twice over again in ver. 50. The Text ≈øaith, they did all things as God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ≈øo did they, Even as exactly as <hi>Noah</hi> did in making the Arke, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 22. or as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did in making the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 16. for their obedience is alike ≈øet out by the ≈øame double expre≈ø≈øion.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ≈øeeing all the people were thus exact in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> commands; it follows, that they did not go out of the doors of their hou≈øes untill the morning of the fifteenth day was come, and yet they went out of the doors of their hou≈øes at Mid-night, or pre≈øently after, becau≈øe they knew that the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fifteenth day was begun at Mid-night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:36425:33"/>
Yea, It is evident that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> intended they ≈øhould all go out of their doors in the Morning pre≈øently after Mid-night, becau≈øe he had foretold them, that all the fir≈øt-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> ≈øhould be ≈ølain at Mid-night, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. 4, 5. And ≈øecondly, He had foretold them that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> would thru≈øt them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> v. 1. and that the Nobles would come and bow down to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaying, <hi>Go thou out and all the people at thy feet, Exod.</hi> 11. 8. Yea, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for a ≈øudden departing from their hou≈øes, becau≈øe he commanded to eat the Pa≈ø≈øeover with their loyns girded, with their ≈øhooes on their feet, and with their ≈øtaves in their hands, and to eat it in ha≈øte, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. all the≈øe things do te≈øtifie that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> intended they ≈øhould go out of the doors of their hou≈øes as ≈øoon as ever the morning of the fifteenth day was come, and he meant it was come as ≈øoon as Midnight was come.</p>
                  <p>Object. 5. <hi>I grant that all</hi> I≈ørael <hi>departed out of</hi> Egypt <hi>on the fifteenth day of</hi> Ni≈øhan, Numb. 33. 3. <hi>But how prove you that they began their journey at Midnight, or that the fifteenth day began at Mid-night?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The circum≈øtances of the Text do prove it plain enough; for as ≈øoon as the <hi>Egyptiaus</hi> ≈øaw all their fir≈øt-born ≈ølain at Mid-night, they feared le≈øt they ≈øhould be all ≈ølain, and therefore they did urge the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> in all ha≈øte to depart, and the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> knew all this before-hand, and accordingly they prepared for their ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy departure, and becau≈øe of this their preparation they are ≈øaid to depart out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the night, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 1. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 29, 31, 42. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> therefore as ≈øoon as their fir≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born were ≈ølain at Midnight, urged the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> in ha≈øte to depart, and then al≈øo the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> did depart out of the doors of their hou≈øes, becau≈øe the morning of the fifteenth day was come, but yet they could not fully depart out of <hi>Egypt</hi> untill the body of the ≈øelf ≈øame day was come, namely, not till it was Mid-day. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 41. they had many bu≈øine≈ø≈øes to do after they went out of the doors of their hou≈øes before they could ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart; for they mu≈øt a≈ø≈øemble together 600000 men befides wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, and many connexed people and cattle, and before all this could be put into a fit po≈øture for their orderly marching away, it was Mid-day, and yet they made extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ha≈øte to bring things thus ≈øoon to pa≈ø≈øe, and through their great ha≈øte they took their Dough as it was unleavened, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it upon their ≈øhoulders, ver. 34. and thenceforth the fifteenth

                  <p>Thirdly, Not onely the manner how, but al≈øo the time when they mu≈øt clean≈øe them≈øelves, was ordained and appointed by the Ceremonial Law.</p>
                  <p>Some kind of defilements might be clen≈øed in one day, but the greate≈øt degrees of their Ceremonial defilements required not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, but many dayes for their clean≈øing; but all were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to begin their clean≈øing in the Evening in two degrees of time, according to the two parts of the Evening, for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36425:34"/>
Evening hath two equal parts (as I have ≈øhewed in Chap. 2. and ≈øhall further ≈øhew it in the next Chapter.)</p>
                  <p>In the fir≈øt Evening (which doth always begin at Mid-day) they mu≈øt baptize or wa≈øh them≈øelves. <note place="margin">The Jews were clean≈øed from their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1. By wa≈øhing in the afternoon; And 2. By the Suns ≈øetting upon them after their bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ≈øecond Evening (which doth alwaies begin at Sun-≈øet) they did begin to date the day of their cleanne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>For by the ≈øetting of the Sun upon them, after their wa≈øhing, two things were effected; Fir≈øt, Their cleanne≈øs by their former wa≈øhing was confirmed or made perfect; And ≈øecondly, As ≈øoon as their cleanne≈øs was made perfect, they began the day of their cleanne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>Might not the unclean per≈øon baptize him≈øelf from his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial defilements in the latter evening after Sun-≈øet, as well as in the time of the fir≈øt Evening before Sun-≈øet?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈ø.</hi> He might not, becau≈øe God had appointed the time of the two Evenings for two di≈øtinct degrees of their clean≈øing<hi>:</hi> The fir≈øt Evening from Mid-day to Sun-≈øet was allotted to them for the wa≈øhing or baptizing them≈øelves from their ceremonial ≈øins, and this was onely as a preparation to the day of their cleanne≈øs, And this I will labor to make evident ≈øeveral waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 11. doth command the unclean per≈øon to bath him≈øelf in water, <hi>at the looking forth of the Evening.</hi> So the Hebrew phra≈øe is, but it may be demanded, what time is that, that is meant by the looking forth of the Evening?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I have ≈øhewed you in chap. 2. and in chap. 5. that the Evening doth fir≈øt begin at the fir≈øt declining of the Sun at Mid-day, and that it looks forth towards his ≈øetting in the we≈øt from the very fir≈øt declining of the Sun from Mid-day untill it depart from that Horizon, and to this ≈øen≈øe I have expounded the ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Evening to look forth, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 6, 4. See Chap. 2.</p>
                  <p>In like ≈øort it is ≈øaid of <hi>I≈øaack,</hi> that he went out into the fields to meditate <hi>at the looking forth of the Evening,</hi> Gen. 24. 63. In tho≈øe daies they had no private upper Rooms to meditate in, becau≈øe they lived in Tents, and therefore they u≈øed to ≈øeque≈øter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves by going out into the fields to meditate, where they had Groves of Trees for ≈øhade and refre≈øhing, and thither the godly u≈øed to go to meditate or to ≈øtudy divine my≈øteries in the heat of the day, at the fir≈øt looking forth of the Evening. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 55. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:36425:35"/>
In like ≈øort, they u≈øed to bathe or baptize them≈øelves from their Ceremonial defilements at the looking forth of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then al≈øo the water was well warmed by the Sun, and ≈øo made the more fit for bathing. I grant al≈øo, that it was lawfull for them to bathe them≈øelves from their Ceremonial defilements all the time that the Sun looked forth by his ≈øhadowes towards the We≈øt, till it was ready to depart out of that Horizon. But this is to be marked, that none were commanded to baptize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in any part of the morning (onely the Prie≈øts were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to wa≈øh their hands and their feet every morning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were clean before. See <hi>Ain≈ø. in Exod.</hi> 30. 19, 20.) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they commanded to baptize them≈øelves after Sun-≈øet, for except they were baptized before Sun-≈øet, they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the day of their cleanne≈ø≈øe at Sun-≈øet, according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is evident, that the appointed ≈øea≈øon for baptizing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves from all their Ceremonial defilements was in the time of the fir≈øt Evening, by the Example of <hi>Bath≈øhebaes</hi> baptizing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf.</p>
                  <p>The Text ≈øaith, it was in the Evening when <hi>David aro≈øe from his bed and walked upon the Roof of the Kings hou≈øe,</hi> then <hi>he ≈øaw a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wa≈øhing her ≈øelf, and the woman was very beautiful to look upon,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. 2. This Evening when <hi>David</hi> aro≈øe from his bed, cannot be under≈øtood of the latter Sun-≈øet Evening, for then for want of Sun-light he could not have di≈øcerned her beauty from the Roof of his hou≈øe, but it mu≈øt be under≈øtood of the afternoon Evening; for in tho≈øe hot Countries they u≈øed to ≈øleep in the afternoon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øome Bed or Pallat, as <hi>I≈øhbo≈øheth</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 5. from whence he aro≈øe and walked upon the flat Roof of his hou≈øe, and thence he beheld the beauty of <hi>Bath≈øheba</hi> as ≈øhe was baptizing her ≈øelf; hence it may be gathered, that the unclean per≈øons did u≈øe to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them≈øelves from their Ceremonial defilements in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Evening.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is al≈øo evident, that they baptized them≈øelves in the after-noon Evening from their Ceremonial defilements by a famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in <hi>Jo≈øh.</hi> 7. for when the Lords wrath was gone out again≈øt them, in that the men of <hi>Ai</hi> ≈ølew about thirty ≈øix of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that <hi>Achan</hi> had ≈øtoln the excommunicate thing; then ≈øaid the Lord to <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> at the Even-tide, <hi>

                  <p n="4">4 All <hi>I≈ørael</hi> were warned when ever they came before the Lords pre≈øence in his Tabernacle, to be clean≈øed from their Ceremonial defilements, e≈øpecially at their three ≈øolemn fea≈øts; but they were not tyed to the ob≈øervation of their Ceremonial baptizing when they re≈øorted to their Synagogues on their weekly Sabbath daies, for in tho≈øe places both the clean and the unclean might meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Gods wor≈øhip, as I have opened the matter in my di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe of the Jews Synagogues Di≈øcipline.</p>
                  <p>But under pain of the Lords di≈øplea≈øure none might approach to the Lords Sanctuary without their legal purificati<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ons, as it is manife≈øt by the example of Gods di≈øplea≈øure again≈øt ≈øome of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> &amp; <hi>Mana≈ø≈øes</hi> when they came to the Pa≈ø≈øeover in the daies of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> with out their purifications; but as ≈øoon as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their error (which doubtle≈øs the con≈øciences of the vi≈øited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons made them to acknowledge) he prayed to the Lord for them, &amp; the Lord was intreated, and healed the people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 19, 20. and for the better avoiding of this error afterwards, it was ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a cu≈øtom among the Jews, to go out of the Country up to <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> before the Fea≈øt of Pa≈ø≈øeover, to purifie them≈øelves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 55. which purification was effected by two degrees of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs: Fir≈øt, By baptizing them≈øelves in the fir≈øt Evening; And ≈øecondly, By the Sun-≈øetting upon them after their baptizing (as I have formerly proved the matter) for none might approach the Sanctuary until they could declare their purification to the Prie≈øts that were the Porters, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 19. as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 26.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord did ≈øo much approve of their Ceremonial pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both by their actual baptizing and by their ab≈øtinence from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36425:36"/>
unclean meats, and from all other things el≈øe that might defile them: That for that very obedience he doth cal the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">All I≈ørael are called men of Holine≈øs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ceremonial purity.</note> 
                     <hi>Men of holine≈øs, Exod.</hi> 22. 31. for all the Nation in general were very careful to maintain this kind of holine≈øs.

                  <p>And thus much touching the fir≈øt degree of time in which they mu≈øt perform the fir≈øt degree of their Ceremonial clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 2.</head>
                  <p>I Come now to ≈øpeak of the ≈øecond degree of time wherein their Ceremonial cleanne≈øs was perfected, and that was as ≈øoon as the Sun was ≈øet upon them after their Ceremonial baptizing, and from that time al≈øo they began to date the new day of their cleanne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, I prove that God ordained the Sun-≈øet Evening to be the time of perfecting the cleanne≈øs of the baptized per≈øon, ere he <note place="margin">None were compleatly purified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized til the Sun was ≈øet upon them.</note> could begin the day of his cleanne≈øs, by <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 10, 11. There <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaith thus to all <hi>I≈ørael, If there be in thee a man that is not clean by rea≈øon of an accident in the night, then he ≈øhall go out of the Camp; and he ≈øhall hath him≈øelf in water at the looking forth of the Evening</hi> (and what then, was he now made clean as ≈øoon as ever he had bathed him≈øelf in water? The an≈øwer is, no, hee mu≈øt yet ≈øtay a while longer without the Camp till his Sun be ≈øet,) <hi>and then when the Sun is gon down he ≈øhall come into the Camp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is evident that his Ceremoniall purity was not compleat until his Sun was ≈øet, but then it was compleat, and therefore he did then begin to date the day of his cleanne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Hence al≈øo I gather, that their Ceremonial baptizing might be done in any part of the afternoon, provided it were done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36425:36"/>
Sun-≈øet, becau≈øe the Sun did look forth towards the place of his going down by his ≈øhadow, from Mid-day, til it went out of that Horizon, as I have formerly explained the matter.</p>
                  <p>But if any were defiled by any accident in the night after his Sun was ≈øet upon him, he mu≈øt remain in that uncleanne≈øs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a new baptizing in the next afternoon, and till a new Sun-≈øet Evening,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is evident, that none were compleatly purified till Sun-≈øet, by <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaith thus, <hi>If any man</hi> (whether Prie≈øt or I≈øraelite) <hi>be made unclean by touching a dead creeping thing,</hi> (or the like unclean thing;) Then (in ver. 6.) <hi>he ≈øhall be unclean untill the Evening, he ≈øhall not eat of the holy things.</hi> But fir≈øt, He ≈øhall bath him≈øelf in water. And then Secondly (≈øaith ver. 7.) when <hi>the Sun is gon down he ≈øhall be clean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Text it is al≈øo evident, that he did not attain to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ceremonial cleanne≈øs by baptizing him≈øelf in water, untill the Sun was gon down upon him after his bathing: But as ≈øoon as his Sun was ≈øet, then he was compleatly purified, and then al≈øo he began to date the day of his cleanne≈øs, and then al≈øo he might eat of the holy things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Hebrew Doctors do abundantly te≈øtifie that no baptized per≈øon did begin the day of his cleanne≈øs untill his Sun was ≈øet; for this is their common and peculiar phra≈øe, <hi>They ≈øhall be unclean untill their Sun be ≈øet:</hi> But the common phra≈øe of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law ≈øaith thus, <hi>They ≈øhall be unclean untill the Evening. The unclean</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Maymony) may not eat of the Heave-Offering untill their Sun be ≈øet.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø. in Lev.</hi> 22. 9, 10. And hence it is evident, that they held the baptized per≈øons to have ≈øome degree of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanne≈øs upon them, untill their Sun was ≈øet: And therefore <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith thus; He that is baptized is the ≈øecond in unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, untill his Sun be ≈øet; And he that is ≈øo baptized (if his Sun bee not ≈øet) may not eat or drink of the <hi>Trumah</hi> (or holy offerings) nor of any meat or drink that is holy. See <hi>Ain≈ø. in Lev.</hi> 11. 32. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 20, 21. and in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 19, 20, 21. This phra≈øe in the Law, <hi>He ≈øhall be unclean untill the Evening,</hi> is eight times over repeated in <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. and fourteen times over in <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. and often el≈øewhere: But the Hebrew Doctors do u≈øually expre≈øs it, <hi>He ≈øhall be unclean till his Sun be ≈øet;</hi> they accounted the term Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øet and the term Evening to be all one time. Hence then it follows,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36425:37"/>
that the date of their new day of cleanne≈øs did alwaies begin at the Sun-≈øet Evening.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is evident, that the Jews began the date of their new day of cleanne≈øs at the Sun-≈øet Evening; becau≈øe the Sun-≈øet <note place="margin">The Jews mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row began at Sun-≈øet in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects.</note> Evening is called <hi>[Their morning]</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. <hi>David</hi> and his men are ≈øaid to pur≈øue after the <hi>Amalekites, From the twilight unto the Evening of Their Morrow;</hi> that is to ≈øay, from the Twilight in the Morning until their Morrow, which began at the Sun-≈øet Evening; it was a cu≈øtom that was proper and peculiar unto them, &amp; differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from other Nations, to date the new day of their cleanne≈øs from the Sun-≈øet Evening; and therefore the Hebrew Text doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the word <hi>Their</hi> unto <hi>David</hi> and his men in ≈øpecial, calling it <hi>their morrow;</hi> Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> doth explain the word <hi>Morrow</hi> to be the next day after <hi>David</hi> &amp; his men were ≈øet forth to pur≈øue the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> But the text doth not ≈øay ≈øo, but that <hi>David and his men fell upon the Amalekites and pur≈øued their victory, from the Twilight</hi> (in the morning) <hi>untill the Evening of their morrow,</hi> that is, till the Sun-≈øet Evening, for at that Evening began their Morrow, or their new day to the per≈øon purified.</p>
                  <p>2. It is evident that the Sun-≈øet Evening was the Jews morrow, from the time of their reckoning of the ≈øeven weeks to the day of Pentico≈øt.</p>
                  <p>They are commanded to begin that reckoning <hi>from the morrow of the Sabbath;</hi> meaning by the Sabbath, the fir≈øt day of the fea≈øt of unleavened bread, which God commanded them to ob≈øerve as a Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15. And by the <hi>Morrow</hi> of the Sabbath, is meant the ≈øecond day of the Fea≈øt of unleavened bread, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the Sun-≈øet Evening, at the end of the fir≈øt day, that Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is called the Morrow, (but this is ob≈øervable al≈øo, that the ≈øeventh day of the Fea≈øt of unleavened bread did not end at Sun-≈øet; but the holy fea≈øt of that day continued in the night time after Sun-≈øet) and in this ≈øen≈øe the word <hi>Morrow</hi> mu≈øt be under≈øtood in ver. 11. and 16.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew Doctors ≈øay, they begin this reckoning from the beginning of the day (not from the beginning of the Artificial day as mo≈øt are apt to mi≈øtake their meaning, but) from the night of the ≈øixteenth of <hi>Ni≈øhan.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø. in Lev.</hi> 23. 15. and it is a known thing (as I have explained the matter) that they did account the night to begin at the Sun-≈øet Evening according to the date of the per≈øon purified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:36425:37"/>
And in this ≈øen≈øe the phra≈øe of <hi>The next day</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 62. mu≈øt be under≈øtood; then, the next day that followed the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, mu≈øt be under≈øtood of the Sun-≈øet Evening.</p>
                  <p>3. As <hi>Boker,</hi> the Morning, is put for the beginning of the day, namely, for the beginning of the Natural day, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Artificial day; ≈øo al≈øo, it is once put for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Jews Ceremonial day, or for the Sun-≈øet Evening, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. as I have opened the matter more at large in Chap. 5.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe places do plainly evidence that the Jews had a double Morning, and a double Morrow (as they had a double year) an≈øwerable to the Natural Day and to their Ceremonial Day.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>Though I am willing to grant that all purified per≈øons did</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">It is di≈øputed by ≈øome that the Sun-≈øet Evening is not fully come until it be full Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pa≈øt, or el≈øe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs it cannot be proved that Chri≈øt lay three daies in his grave.</note>

                  <p>I confe≈øs I cannot but wonder that any learned men ≈øhould make the time of Sun-≈øet and the time of Twilight to be all one, for if this be true, then all A≈øtronomers mu≈øt go to School again to learn better how to ≈øet the Minutes of the Suns ri≈øing and of the Suns ≈øetting. But ≈øee what I ≈øay further in an≈øwer to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Chap. 7.</p>
                  <p>And ≈øuppo≈øe a man that holds thus, ≈øhould hire a laborer to <note place="margin">That the time of Sun-≈øet is fully come as ≈øoon as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Sun is gon out of ≈øight, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</note> work in his Garden from Sun-ri≈øing till Sun-≈øet, and ≈øuppo≈øe this Laborer do contract with him to continue at his labor until the preci≈øe time of Sun-≈øet, and accordingly he continues at his labor untill the Body of the Sun is gon out of ≈øight, and then he leaves off and takes witne≈øs of it, and pre≈øently goes to his Ma≈øter for wages according to Contract; his Ma≈øter refu≈øeth to pay him becau≈øe he did not continue at his labor until the preci≈øe

time of Sun-≈øet; he tels him, that the Sun is not yet ≈øet, becau≈øe the Light in the Sky is more in quantity than the Darkne≈øs; for ≈øaith he, the Sun is the cau≈øe of that light, and therefore it is not yet ≈øet, and he takes witne≈øs, and ≈øo they part in di≈øcontent; and becau≈øe they could not agree about the preci≈øe time of Sun-≈øet, they refer this controver≈øie to be determined by competent Judges.</p>
                  <p>And fir≈øt let <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øhew his Judgement, what he means by the time of Sun-≈øet, or by the Suns going down, for he doth ≈øhew his judgement by a familiar example; He directed the Jews how to find out Mount <hi>Gerezim</hi> on the other ≈øide <hi>Jordan, It lies</hi> (≈øaith hee) <hi>behind the way, at the going down of the Sun, Deut.</hi> 11. 30. In the≈øe words <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> doth give them a twofold mark of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It lies behind,</hi> 2. <hi>It lies at the going down of the Sun,</hi> and I have ≈øhewed you in expounding <hi>Job</hi> 23. 8, 9. that this phra≈øe <hi>behind</hi> is often put for the We≈øt. And in this ≈øen≈øe al≈øo ≈øee <hi>Ain≈ø. in Gen.</hi> 14. 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>It lies at the going down of the Sun;</hi> if you ≈øay this going down of the Sun is not meant of the place where the body of the Sun goes out of ≈øight, but of the place of Twilight, then whither might the Jews wander by that mark of direction to ≈øeek out Mount <hi>Gerezim?</hi> For when the darkne≈øs in the Skie is ≈øomewhat more than the light in the Sky, the Jews might wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into the North or into the South as well as into the We≈øt, for the time and place of Twilight is but an uncertain mark to ≈øteer their cour≈øe by to Mount <hi>Gerezim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to place the time of Sun-≈øet where the body of the Sun goes out of ≈øight, is a per≈øpicuous mark for the We≈øt (when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, as it was when this direction was given) and in this re≈øpect the time of Sun-≈øet is often put for the We≈øt. See more in Chap. 2. in an≈øwer to Objection 3. And ≈øee <hi>Ain≈ø. in P≈øal.</hi> 113. 3. and this direction agrees to the fir≈øt direction, it is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, or it is due We≈øt.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary when <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> directed them to other places that lay Ea≈øt, he directed them thither by the Ri≈øing of the Sun, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 34. 15. <hi>Deuter.</hi> 4. 41, 47. <hi>Jo≈øh.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Jo≈øh.</hi> 19. 27, 34.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> al≈øo ≈øhew his judgement about the time
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36425:38"/>
and place of Sun-≈øet, and he declares his judgement by another familiar example, for he directed the <hi>Jews</hi> how to finde out the We≈øt bounds of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not by the confu≈øed, and ob≈øcure mark of Twilight; but fir≈øt, by the per≈øpicuous mark of Sun-≈øet; and ≈øecondly by the hindmo≈øt Sea, <hi>Jo≈ø.</hi> 1. 4. he makes the hindmo≈øt Sea, and the going down of the Sun to be marks <hi>Synonima</hi> for the finding out of the We≈øt borders of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and he doth al≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this hindmo≈øt Sea to be the great Sea at Sun-≈øet, <hi>Jo≈ø.</hi> 23. 4. and <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> likewi≈øe doth call this Sea the Hindmo≈øt Sea, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 24. But the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> call it the We≈øtern Sea. So then from the premi≈øes it follows, That ≈øeeing the places that lye due We≈øt, are marked out by the per≈øpicuous mark of the going down of the Sun, we mu≈øt thereby under≈øtand that the Sun-≈øet Evening doth begin as ≈øoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ≈øight; and therefore hence it follows, that tho≈øe that make the time of Sun-≈øet, and the time of Twilight to be all one (for the begining of our Lords day) do build their opinion but on a ≈øandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text doth often expre≈øs the time of Sun-≈øet by the going in of the Sun, to lodge all night (as it were in its chamber) and it is ≈øaid to go in as ≈øoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of our Horizon. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 50. 1. on the contrary, as ≈øoon as the body of the Sun is ri≈øen upon our Horizon in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is ≈øaid <hi>to come forth</hi> as a <hi>Bridegroom out of his chamber,</hi> P≈øal. 19. 5.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Experience will tell you, that the Sun is ≈øet as ≈øoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ≈øight; or el≈øe if it be not ≈øet till the darkne≈ø≈øe in the skie is more than the light in the skie, then there is no Sun-≈øet at all in the North of <hi>England</hi> when the daies are at the longe≈øt, for experience doth te≈øtifie that the light is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the skie there, all the night long, except a little in the middle of the night, and yet experience doth witne≈ø≈øe that the Sun doth truly ≈øet there every day.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Let all A≈øtronomers ≈øhew their judgement when the Sun doth ≈øet, and they with one con≈øent do te≈øtifie that the Sun doth ≈øet as ≈øoon as ever the body of the Sun is gon out of ≈øight, for they de≈øcribe the time of Sun-≈øet, and the time of the Suns ri≈øing, by the fir≈øt appearing of the body of the Sun in the morning, and by the body of the Sun going out of ≈øight in the evening, as all their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacks do te≈øtifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:36425:39"/>
Sixthly, Let the Evangeli≈øt <hi>Marke</hi> ≈øhew his judgement, for he de≈øcribes the Evening to begin at Sun-≈øet, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 32. but <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øpeaking of the ≈øame action ≈øaith, It was when the Sun was ≈øetting, <hi>Luke</hi> 440. put this together, and it implies that the time of the beginning of the Sun-≈øet Evening is as ≈øoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ≈øight.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> doth te≈øtifie that the Evening is come as ≈øoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ≈øight, <hi>Jo≈ø.</hi> 10. 26, 27. and <hi>Daniel</hi> ≈øaith, That <hi>Darius</hi> did labour to deliver him till the going down of the Sun, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 14. But the Seventy ≈øay, till Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>The ≈øoul that toucheth a dead creeping thing ≈øhall be unclean untill the Evening,</hi> Lev. 22. 6. but ≈øaith he, in ver≈ø. 7. <hi>He ≈øhall bathe him≈øelf in water, and then he ≈øhall be clean when the Sun is gone down;</hi> from all the≈øe places it is evident, that the term Sun-≈øet, and the term Evening, are terms convertible for the Sun-≈øet Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, It is evident by this rea≈øon that the latter Evening doth begin as ≈øoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ≈øight, becau≈øe there is no interim between the End of the fir≈øt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, and the Beginning of the latter Evening; and I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chap. 2. that the fir≈øt Evening doth end, as ≈øoon as ever the Sun doth leave off to make any more ≈øhadows upon the face of the Earth: For the whole time of the fir≈øt Evening is de≈øcribed by its ≈øhadows looking forth towards the place of its Re≈øt, or by the ≈øtretching out of its ≈øhadows upon the face of the Earth, as I have expounded, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 4. and therefore it follows by nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence, that the latter Evening mu≈øt begin at that in≈øtant time. This con≈øequence is ≈øo cleer, that none that loves plain truth can deny it.</p>
                  <p>But to prevent ra≈øh zeal, and unadvi≈øed ha≈øte in fea≈øting upon the holy fle≈øh, the Hebrew Doctors advi≈øed to ≈øtay a little time after Sun-≈øet, <note place="margin">They begin their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fe≈øtival Suppers after Sun-≈øet, as ≈øoon as three ≈øtars appeared in the skie.</note> for the Sun mu≈øt go down upon the baptized per≈øon before his Purification was perfected, and then he began the date of his new day, and then he was made fit to eat of the holy fle≈øh; yet they advi≈øed to ≈øtay a little time after Sun-≈øet, namely till three ≈øtars appeared in the skie. <hi>Mamony</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>That the unclean may not eat of the Heave-offering untill their Sun be ≈øet, and three ≈øtars appear after the Sun is gone down.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 9.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I ≈øhewed how God ordained the time of the two
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36425:39"/>
Evenings for the effecting of two degrees of cleanne≈ø≈øe; and now I ≈øhall in the next Section ≈øhew, That all the latter Evening from Sun-≈øet till Mid-night, was appointed for the time of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fea≈øting upon their Pa≈ø≈øeovers, and Peace-offerings; and that this part of the night was a true part of the former natural day.</p>

                  <p>FRom the date of the new Day to the per≈øon purified at the Sun-≈øet Evening, we may ≈øee the true Rea≈øon that did inforce the <hi>Jewes</hi> to begin all their Ceremonial Sabbaths at that time, and of all other dayes by occa≈øion thereof.</p>
                  <p>But this beginning of the day was no more to be accounted for the beginning of the natural Day, than the beginning of their yeer in <hi>Ni≈øhan</hi> was to be accounted for the fir≈øt month by Creation; for they began their yeer in <hi>Ni≈øhan</hi> upon the occa≈øion of their famous deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in that month; but from the Creation the yeer began in <hi>Tizri,</hi> which now is called the Seventh month, and this ≈øeventh month was afterwards made famous again by <hi>Jo≈øhua's</hi> Conque≈øt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by his divi≈øion of the land thereupon to the nine Tribes and a half, in this ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth month, <hi>Jo≈ø.</hi> 14. and in remembrance thereof they began all their yeers of Re≈øt, and all their Jubiles from that month. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 1, 2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 22. and likewi≈øe the yeers of all Servants and Lea≈øes began at this time, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>And after this manner they ob≈øerved a double date according to the beginning of their double day. <note place="margin">The Jews ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved both the date of their ceremonial day, and the date of their natural day for ≈øeveral purpo≈øes. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in Lev. 23. 20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 The per≈øon purified began the date of his day of cleanne≈ø≈øe from the Sun-≈øet Evening.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They dated the time of their Religious fea≈øting according to the natural day till midnight after; for by the Law they were expre≈øly commanded to eat the fle≈øh of their Peace-offerings in the ≈øame day, in which it was ≈øacrificed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. now it was not po≈ø≈øible for them (at ≈øometimes at lea≈øt) to eat the holy fle≈øh of their Pa≈ø≈øeovers, and of their commanded Peace-offerings, in the ≈øame Ceremonial day, becau≈øe the time of ≈øacrificing their Pa≈ø≈øeovers and Peace-offerings did many times continue until it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36425:40"/>
was night, namely till Sun-≈øet; and ≈øo it fell out in the time of <hi>Jo≈øias</hi> Pa≈ø≈øeover, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 14. Hence it follows by a nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence, That the command to eat the holy fle≈øh in the ≈øame day mu≈øt be under≈øtood (not of the ≈øame Ceremonial, but) of the ≈øame natural day; and in ca≈øe any of the holy fle≈øh had remained uneaten in the ≈øame day in which it was ≈øacrificed, it mu≈øt be burnt, and then ≈øometime it mu≈øt be all burnt, and none of it eaten, namely when it was ≈øacrificed at the point of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the date of their Ceremonial day had born all the ≈øway, then they mu≈øt not only have fini≈øhed the killing of all their Sacrifices, but of all their Religious fea≈øts al≈øo, before Sun-≈øet, and then our Saviour and his Apo≈øtles had ≈øinned, becau≈øe they kept their Religious Fea≈øt after Sun-≈øet, namely in the night wherein he was betrayed; for though they cau≈øed their Pa≈ø≈øeover to be ≈øacrificed on the fourteenth day, yet they deferred the time of their fea≈øting till after Sun-≈øet when the fifteenth day was begun, according to the date of the per≈øon purified. But if you will grant that our Saviour did not ≈øin again≈øt that Command of eating their Pa≈ø≈øeover in the ≈øame day, then you mu≈øt al≈øo grant that the ≈øame fourteenth day by Creation was not ended at Sun-≈øet, but continued ≈øtill till Mid-night after.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hence it follows, that ≈øeeing all Ceremonial Cu≈øtomes are now aboli≈øhed by the death of Chri≈øt; that Gods people ought not to Judaize, in beginning the Lords day according to the Jews Ceremonial Cu≈øtomes, but according to the beginning and ending of the natural day from midnight to Mid-night.</p>
                  <p>Objection 3. <hi>How could the</hi> Jewes <hi>ob≈øerve a double date of a double day in one and the ≈øame naturall day without confu≈øion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Their double date of their double day was not ≈øtrange to them, no more than their double date of their double yeer was to them; they could ≈øort out ≈øuch things, as belonged to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yeer from the ≈øeventh month from the things that belonged to the beginning of the yeer in the fir≈øt month, without any confu≈øion at all; ≈øo in like manner they could ≈øort out all tho≈øe Religious duties that belonged to their Ceremonial date, from tho≈øe duties that belonged to the date of the naturall day.

They knew that the Bapti≈øed per≈øon mu≈øt begin his new day at Sun-≈øet, and that all Evening Sacrifices mu≈øt be fini≈øhed before Sun-≈øet; and yet in re≈øpect of the time of Fea≈øting, they knew that the ≈øame Natural day did ≈øtill continue till mid-night; <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> ≈øaith, That the Prie≈øts mu≈øt eat the Peace-offerings of the Congregation in the ≈øame Day, and in half the Night. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 20. Hence you may ≈øee, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, whom <hi>Maymony</hi> follows, did hold that the ≈øame day (in the ca≈øe of Fea≈øting) did continue till mid-night; and indeed this time was ≈øufficient for the accompli≈øhment of all their religious Fea≈øts; in like ≈øort <hi>Solomon</hi> cals the Twilight evening of the night, the ≈øame day wherein the Sacrifice was ≈ølain, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9. but it was not the ≈øame Ceremonial day, for at Sun ≈øet the <hi>Jews</hi> began their next day, or their morrow; but for a fuller an≈øwer, ≈øee my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer in Ch. 5. to <hi>Obj.</hi> 8. &amp; 14. &amp; 17.</p>

               <p>I Have ≈øhewed in Cha. 2. and Sect. 2. that the natural Evening was divided into two equal parts, and now I ≈øhall ≈øhew you, that the Pa≈ø≈øeover was ≈øolemnized in both the parts of that Evening.</p>

                  <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi> expounds the two evenings thus; From the ≈øixth hour (which is at Mid-day) and forwards, it is called between the two Evenings, for that the Sun declineth towards his going down, &amp;c. between the evening of the day, and the evening of the night; the evening of the Day is from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ≈øeventh hour, and the evening of the Night is when the night begins. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 3.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith thus; The killing of the Pa≈ø≈øeover is after Mid-day, and if they kill it before it is not allowable; and they kill it not but after the daily evening Sacrifice, and burning of Incen≈øe, and after they have trimmed the Lamps, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to kill the Pa≈øchal Lamb, until the end of the day. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
               <p>Till the end of the day was, till the Sun-≈øet evening, for after Sun-≈øet (≈øaith <hi>Maymony)</hi> the blood of all Sacrifices became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
               <p>Hence we ≈øee that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors held it as a Canon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that no Pa≈ø≈øeover was allowable, if it were killed either before Mid-day, or after Sun-≈øet; but all the time between was Gods appointed ≈øea≈øon, <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 4.</p>
               <p>Ordinarily they began to kill their Pa≈ø≈øeovers at half an hour after two a Clock, but if the Pa≈ø≈øeover day fell out to be the <note n="*" place="margin">Some think of no other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath, but the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; but they are gro≈øly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaken, for that was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sabbath but in relation to the new day to the purified per≈øon, but the evening of the Sabbath if ≈øelf began and ended as the Pa≈ø≈øeover evening did from mid-day to mid-night.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of the Sabbath (namely, that evening of the Sabbath which began at Mid-day) then they began to kill their Pa≈ø≈øeover ≈øonner; But (≈øtill this mu≈øt be remembred which <hi>Maymony</hi> often noteth, that) they never kild any Pa≈ø≈øeover till after the daily eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacrifice, and ≈øome other ≈øervices that did ever accompany it.

But (≈øay the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors) God ≈øetteth no particular hour, neither for the killing of the daily evening Sacrifice, nor yet for the killing of the Pa≈ø≈øeover; but in general, he commanded them to be killed between the two evenings.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, That if they killed the daily evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or the Pa≈ø≈øeover, or the Peace-offerings, in any part of the after-noon, between the time of Mid-day and the Sun-≈øet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they were allowable, and according to Gods own limited time.</p>
               <p>But becau≈øe God requires that all his Wor≈øhip in all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances of it ≈øhould be done decently, and in order, both in regard of time, place, and per≈øons; therefore the chief Rulers of the people, thought it their duty to ≈øuit all the particular bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øes about the Pa≈ø≈øeover, and the daily evening Sacrifice, to certain particular hours in the evening, ≈øo as all things might be done with the be≈øt conveniency, decency, and order, that one duty might not ≈øhoulder out another.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors in the <hi>Babylonian Thalmud</hi> ≈øay thus; the daily evening Sacrifice was killed at the eighth hour and a half, and it was offered at the ninth hour and a half (that is to ≈øay, at half an hour after three a Clock) But in the evening of the Pa≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it was killed at the ≈øeventh hour and a half, and offered at the eighth hour and a half (that is to ≈øay, at half an hour after two a Clock) But if the evening of the Pa≈ø≈øeover did fall out to be upon the evening of the Sabbath, then it was killed at the ≈øixth hour and a half (that is to ≈øay, at half an hour after twelve a Clock) and it was offered at ≈øeven and a half. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> al≈øo in his <hi>Hebrew Lexicon</hi> upon the word <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> doth from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ≈øhew, that if the Pa≈ø≈øeover evening fell upon the Sabbath evening, that then they began to kill the daily evening Sacrifice at half an hour after twelve a Clock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of the manifold bu≈øine≈ø≈øes that belonged to the Sabbath, be≈øides the killing of their Pa≈ø≈øeovers; therefore that the doing of one duty might not thru≈øt out another, their Wi≈øe-men did ≈øet an order of time when they ≈øhould begin to kill the daily evening Sacrifice, which in all the days of the year was deferred to the la≈øt place, except on the Pa≈ø≈øeover evening, and then it was ever preferred to the fir≈øt place, and when ever the Pa≈ø≈øeover evening
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36425:42"/>
fell upon a Sabbath, then they began to kill it at half an hour after twelve a Clock, and that was as ≈øoon as ever they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ≈øhadow of the evening to be ≈øtretched out, or declined; and the only rea≈øon why they began thus early upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath evening, was, becau≈øe they might have ≈øufficient time to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh all the duties of the Sabbath, and all their Pa≈ø≈øeovers, before Sun-≈øet, for after Sun-≈øet the blood of all Sacrifices became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, becau≈øe God had expre≈øly commanded all evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to be killed between the two Evenings, and becau≈øe they had much work to do on Pa≈ø≈øeover evenings, e≈øpecially when it fell on the Sabbath, they mu≈øt begin to kill the daily evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at the fir≈øt declining of the Sun, or el≈øe they could not kill all by Sun-≈øet; for in the time of <hi>Jo≈øiahs</hi> Pa≈ø≈øeover, the Pa≈ø≈øeovers, and Peace-offerings were ≈øo many, that the Prie≈øts could not fini≈øh all till night, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 14.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>You have often cited the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors, as if they did all agree in one, That the Natural evening did begin at Mid-day; but Mr.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Shepheard <hi>in his third Part on the Sabbath,</hi> The≈øis 36. <hi>doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors te≈øtimonies are of little worth, becau≈øe they do often contradict one another about the beginning of the evening, for though ≈øome of them do ≈øay, that the evening doth begin at Mid-day, yet they are over-whelmed with cro≈ø≈øe te≈øtimonies, from the mo≈øt of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who begin it ≈øome about one, ≈øome about two a Clock in the afternoon; and</hi> Jo≈øephus, <hi>who is one of mo≈øt credit, in his Writings tels us, That they began their fir≈øt evening about three a Clock in the afternoon.</hi>

I grant that ≈øome of them do ≈øpeak of the beginning of the Evening at one hour, and ≈øome at another, and yet all this without any contradiction; for in regard of ≈øeverall duties that mu≈øt be tran≈ø-acted at ≈øeveral hours in the evening, they had ju≈øt occa≈øion to ≈øpeak of the beginning of the evening at ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours, in relation to the ≈øaid ≈øeveral duties that mu≈øt begin at ≈øeveral hours of the ≈øaid evening, as I noted it in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. at ≈øeventhly, and as I have noted it immediately afore from the <hi>Babylonian Thalmud.</hi>

               <p>If the <hi>Jewes</hi> had thought it as lawful for them to kill the Pa≈ø≈øeover in a private hou≈øe (ever ≈øince the de≈øtruction of the Temple) as they did at the fir≈øt Pa≈ø≈øeover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe they would not have omitted to ≈øacrifice the Pa≈ø≈øeover now in all the places of their di≈øper≈øion; but ever ≈øince their Temple was de≈øtroyed, they have been without the Pa≈ø≈øeover, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all other Sacrifices for the ≈øpace of ≈øixteen hundred yeers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; And thus ≈øpeaketh Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: He that ≈øhall kill the <hi>Pa≈øcha,</hi> ever ≈øince Je≈øus Chri≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Canaan,</hi> in a private hou≈øe, had been held an open enemy to the truth of God.

               <p>This brazen Altar was made and con≈øecrated to be the publick Altar for the General A≈ø≈øemblies of all the twelve Tribes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. 1. and in that re≈øpect where ever this Altar was placed, there was the chief High place, untill <hi>Solomon</hi> had made another brazen Alrar in the place of it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>At this Altar was offered the daily Morning and Evening ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for all the twelve Tribes, and the Pa≈ø≈øeovers of all the twelve Tribes, and they might not be offered in any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer private High places: The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ≈øay, They ≈øacrificed not the Pa≈ø≈øeover in a private High-place (no not in the time

when private High-places were permitted) and who≈øoever offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Pa≈ø≈øeover in a private High-place is beaten; for it is ≈øaid in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Thou maye≈øt not ≈øacrifice the Pa≈ø≈øeover in any of thy gates:</hi> we have been taught, that this is a prohibition to kil it in a private High-place, although it be in the time when private High-places were permitted.

               <p>Now from all the premi≈øes it follows, That ≈øeeing they might not kill their Pa≈ø≈øeovers at ≈øeveral High-places, nor ≈øprinkle the blood on ≈øeveral Altars, but at the general High-place, and at the general Altar onely, That all the Pa≈ø≈øeovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> could not be killed, and their blood ≈øprinkled in ≈øo ≈øhort a time as about the time of Sun-≈øet, and therefore that Command in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. at the going down of the Sun, mu≈øt not be under≈øtood of the Sun-≈øet Evening, but it mu≈øt be under≈øtood of the whole time of the Suns declining from Mid-day till Sun-≈øet, ju≈øt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time of the two Evenings in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
               <p>2. Let me adde another Rea≈øon why the going down of the Sun <note place="margin">The Pa≈ø≈øeover day was no Sabbath, it was but a half holy-day.</note> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. cannot be under≈øtood of the time of Sun-≈øet; namely becau≈øe the fifteenth day according to the date of the per≈øon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, began at Sun-≈øet; but no Pa≈ø≈øeover might be ≈øacrificed after the fifteenth day was come, but all are commanded to be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed in the fourteenth day at Even.</p>
               <p>3. No other part of the fourteenth day was commanded to be kept holy, but the Evening of the fourteenth day<hi>:</hi> The <hi>Jeru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy,</hi> and the <hi>Babylonian Thalmuds</hi> ≈øay, that men might follow their work and labour all the fir≈øt half of the day; but at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (≈øay they) they mu≈øt leave off, and begin their Re≈øt. <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> al≈øo ≈øaith, <hi>It is not unlawful to do work in the fourteenth of</hi> Ni≈øhan, <hi>≈øave from the mid≈øt of the day, and ≈øo forwards; But</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>who≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth work in the Pa≈ø≈øeover Evening after Mid-day, he is to be ≈øcourged or excommunicated, becau≈øe the Evening of the fourteenth day of</hi> Ni≈øhan, <hi>is not like to the Evening of other Fe≈øtival dayes, becau≈øe in it is the Sacrifice, and the Fea≈øt.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:36425:45"/>
From the≈øe Te≈øtimonies of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors may be ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the≈øe four <hi>Thalmudical</hi> Tenents.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the fourteenth of <hi>Ni≈øhan</hi> was not a full holy-day (as ≈øome do unadvi≈øedly affirm) it was no more but a half-holiday, namely the full Evening onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the <hi>Jews</hi> ob≈øerved two ≈øorts of Evenings to every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; one before the Sabbath for the date of the per≈øon purified; and another from Mid-day, and ≈øo forwards; for the Evening of the 14. of <hi>Ni≈øhan</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Maymony)</hi> is not like unto the evening of other Fe≈øtival dayes, becau≈øe in it is the Sacrifice, and the Fea≈øt; But the Evening of other Fe≈øtival dayes, meaning the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had no ≈øacrifice; but yet the Mid-day Evening of every Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtival Sabbath was as holy as the Pa≈ø≈øeover Evening, and had Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and fea≈øting belonging to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That the Evening of the fourteenth day was the time of ≈øacrificing all their Pa≈ø≈øeovers.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That from the time of Sun-≈øet till Mid-night was the time of Fea≈øting on the Pa≈ø≈øeover, and that it belonged to the Evening of the fourteenth day.</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude, that when <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> commanded them to kill all their Pa≈ø≈øeovers in the Evening about the going down of the Sun, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. he did not mean it of the Sun-≈øet Evening, but of the Mid-day Evening, for then the Sun doth fir≈øt begin to go down, or decline.</p>

               </list>
               <p>And this was no impo≈ø≈øible, but a fecible thing, if all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of quick di≈øpatch be rightly weighed.</p>
               <p n="1">1 There was a competent number of Prie≈øts &amp; Levites that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon this ≈øervice; for though at fir≈øt the number of the Prie≈øts and Levites in the Wilderne≈ø≈øe from thirty yeers old to fifty, was but eight thou≈øand five hundred and eighty, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 48. yet at length they were ≈øo multiplied, that in the dayes of <hi>David</hi> they were eight and thirty thou≈øand men, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 3.

               <p n="3">3 Though no Levite might ≈øprinkle the blood of any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon the Altar, yet for the quicker di≈øpatch of many Sacrifices <note place="margin">No I evites, none but Prie≈øts onely mu≈øt ≈øprinkle the blood of the ≈øacrifice upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</note> they might kill and receive the blood in Bowls, and ≈øo bring it to the Prie≈øts that ≈øtood ready at the foot of the Altar to receive it, and to ≈øprinkle it upon the Altar; for no Levite, but Prie≈øts onely might ≈øprinkle the blood upon the Altar; for the ≈øprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blood was of the E≈ø≈øence of the ≈øacrifice as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors do collect.

Pa≈ø≈øeovers and Peace-offerings between Mid-day and Sun-≈øet; and there is a cleer example that all this was done in the time and manner afore≈øaid in the eighteenth yeer of <hi>Jo≈øias,</hi> and yet there never was the like Pa≈ø≈øeover kept in <hi>I≈ørael</hi> (namely not when <hi>I≈ørael</hi> was joyned with <hi>Judah,</hi> there was not the like Pa≈ø≈øeover, and yet doubtle≈ø≈øe, there were as many Pa≈øchal Lambs, but never the like multitude of Peace-offerings that were added to the Pa≈ø≈øeover, and in that re≈øpect they were called the Pa≈ø≈øeover, as they are in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. 4.) from the dayes of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet unto that day, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 35. 18.</p>

                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> As for the great bu≈øine≈øs of Ro≈øting ≈øo many Pa≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs, It was not tyed precizely to the Temple as the ≈øacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing was: for though there were many Pa≈ø≈øeovers Ro≈øted in the Temple, as there were in the dayes of <hi>Jo≈øiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 13. yet that bu≈øine≈øs might al≈øo be tran≈ømitted to any hou≈øe in the Holy City, as I ≈øhewed a little before, and as the example of our Saviour, and his Apo≈øtles doth te≈øtifie; for our Saviour was at <hi>Bethany,</hi> when he ≈øent two of his Di≈øciples to make ready the Pa≈ø≈øeover; 1 By carrying their Lamb to the Temple to be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and thence to a private hou≈øe in the holy City to be ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted; and as ≈øoon as the Sun-≈øet Evening was come, our Saviour came to the place appointed, and as ≈øoon as the hour for fea≈øting was come, our Saviour ≈øat down with the twelve, and he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in fea≈øting with the twelve fir≈øt on the Pa≈ø≈øeover, and then 2 on their Peace-offerings, with his prayers and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">It was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for above twenty per≈øons to joyn together for one Pa≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</note> the full time of the latter Evening from Sun-≈øet till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 18, 20.

               <p>By this means we may perceive that all the Pa≈øsovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> might well be di≈øpatched in the Evening of the fourteenth day, in the fir≈øt Evening they might be all ≈øacrificed, and in the ≈øecond Evening they might all be fea≈øted on with Religious ≈øolemnity, without any doubt to the contrary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Hebrew Doctors do prote≈øt, that they puni≈øh him that pa≈ø≈øeth the fourteenth day for the killing of the Pa≈øcha; <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith, it is an expre≈ø≈øe Commandment to kill the Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha in the month <hi>Ni≈øhan,</hi> in the 14th. day, and (≈øaith he) he that breaketh this Commandment and killeth it not in the 14th. day, being not defiled, nor in a far journey, is guilty of being rooted out (or cut off) thus the <hi>Iews</hi> prote≈øt again≈øt our ≈ølander.

               <p>Fifthly, This our gro≈ø≈øe mi≈øtake of the <hi>Iews</hi> practi≈øe doth ari≈øe from our mi≈øtake of the meaning of the word Pa≈ø≈øeover, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 28. he ≈øaith thus; <hi>The Iews went not into</hi> Pilate: <hi>common Hall le≈øt they ≈øhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Pa≈ø≈øeover;</hi> and in ch. 19. 14. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>It was the preparation of the Pa≈ø≈øeover, and about the ≈øixth hour.</hi> Hence ≈øome that are not wel acquainted with the <hi>Iews</hi> cu≈øtoms, which are now recorded in their <hi>Thalmuds,</hi> as the learned do ob≈øerve, have collected this inference, that the <hi>Iews</hi> tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

               <p>
                  <hi>Maymony</hi> al≈øo ≈øaith, When they offered the Pa≈ø≈øeover in the fir≈øt Month, they offered it with the Peace-offerings of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, Oxen, or Flock-bea≈øts, great or ≈ømall, Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; but they offered not the <hi>Chagigah</hi> if the Lamb ≈øufficed the company, and ≈øo it was voluntary and not forced by (any affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative) Commandment, and it was eaten two days and one night (and not in the ≈øecond night, as M. <hi>Weames</hi> doth mi≈øtaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øay.)</p>

broken, and that they might be taken down, le≈øt their cruelty, in ≈øuffering them to hang longer on the Tree, ≈øhould be a blot to their joyful Fea≈øt, for this day was the fir≈øt of unleavened Bread, which was the fir≈øt and the chief of all their High Sabbaths: Now as ≈øoon as the chief Prie≈øts had made this reque≈øt to <hi>Pilate, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> did wi≈øely e≈øpy the advantage of time, and then he al≈øo went boldly unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> reque≈øting that he might have the Body of Je≈øus in his own power to bury it.

               <p>Their Satanical policy would not ≈øuffer them to ≈øtay ≈øo long as until the next morning, for then <hi>Pilate</hi> would have ≈øaid to them, Why did you neglect to ≈øet a Watch about his Sepulcre over night, as ≈øoon as he was buried, for if his Di≈øciples had had any minde to ≈øteale him away they would have done it in the fir≈øt part of the night? and doubtle≈ø≈øe when the Souldiers came to

the chief Prie≈øts to tell them what had happened, the chief Prie≈øts would have ≈øaid that his Di≈øciples ≈øtole him away before they began their watch; but the chief Prie≈øts could not plead that excu≈øe becau≈øe they went pre≈øently to the ≈øepulchre, and made it ≈øure, ≈øealing the ≈øtone, and ≈øetting a watch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 66. Hence it follows, that they went to <hi>Pilate</hi> in the beginning of their next Ceremonial day, namely pre≈øently after Sun-≈øet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they began their Fe≈øtival Supper.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Pilates</hi> an≈øwer to their reque≈øt implies that they came over-night, for <hi>Pilate</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>You have a Watch, go make it ≈øure as you know.</hi> Hence it follows, that they came to <hi>Pilate</hi> when Watches were wont to be ≈øet; but if they had not come to him til the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then in rea≈øon he would have ≈øaid, <hi>Get Warders, and make it ≈øure.</hi> Hence it follows, that the next day in which they came to <hi>Pilate</hi> was at the Sun-≈øet Evening, for that was their next day, or it was their morrow, as I have opened, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 15. All the≈øe con≈øiderations laid together make it evident that the time ere Chri≈øt was inclo≈øed in the heart of the earth, was when the Sabbath began to lighten with ≈øtars.</p>
               <p>Object. 13. <hi>How can you call their Fe≈øtival Supper the proper Fea≈øt that doth mo≈øt properly belong to the first day of <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nleavened-bread; had they not a Fe≈øtival Dinner belonging to this High Sabbath as well as a Fe≈øtival Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I grant they had a Fe≈øtival Dinner belonging to this day, as well as a Fe≈øtival Supper; but my meaning is, that their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtival Dinner was not intirely made of the ≈øacrifices of this day, as their Fe≈øtival Supper was: for part of their Fe≈øtival Dinner (at lea≈øt) was made of the Remainder of tho≈øe Peace-offerings which were ≈øacrificed in the former day with the Lamb-Pa≈ø≈øeover, and ≈øo by that means their fe≈øtival Dinner did partake of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the fourteenth day; but their Fe≈øtival Supper was made intirely of the Sacrifices of the fifteenth day, and yet this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Fea≈øt was kept in the night after the date of the Ceremonial beginning of the ≈øixteenth day, in which none of the fle≈øh of their Chagigah-Pa≈ø≈øeover might remain, for that had been to keep the holy fle≈øh within the third day, which was plainly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the letter of the Law: Hence it followes, that all the fle≈øh of their Chagigah-Pa≈ø≈øeover mu≈øt be eaten at Dinner, or el≈øe if any of it did remain untill the beginning of the ≈øixteenth day it mu≈øt

be burnt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17. and therefore it follows that this high Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Supper was intirely made of the Sacrifices of the fifteenth day, and in that re≈øpect, it was the mo≈øt proper ≈øolemn Fea≈øt of this High Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Object 14. <hi>It ≈øeems to me that</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>doth allow the fle≈øh of the Chagigah-Pa≈ø≈øeover to remain unto the morning of the third day, in</hi> Deu. 16. 4. <hi>and that is a longer time than you ≈øpeak of from</hi> Lev. 7. 17. <note place="margin">

I have given ≈øeveral in≈øtances) and accordingly in this place it is figuratively put for the beginning of the Ceremonial day at Sun-≈øet; for <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. might not give a contrary Law to what he had before given in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17. There he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øly ≈øay, that none of the fle≈øh of the voluntary Peace-offerings ≈øhall remain untill the third day, if any thing thereof remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the third day it ≈øhall be burnt. Hence it follows by nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence, that <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning, in <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 4. mu≈øt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a figurative ≈øen≈øe for the beginning of their Ceremonial day at Sun-≈øet, and therefore none of the fle≈øh of the Chagigah-Pa≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>(Mo≈øes</hi> doth not ≈øpeak of the Lamb-Pa≈ø≈øeover in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. but of the Cagigah-Pa≈ø≈øeover) of Sheep and Oxen, which were ≈øacrificed in the fourteenth day with the Pa≈øchal Lamb, none of this fle≈øh might remain untill the beginning, or untill the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ≈øixteenth day at Sun-≈øet, for then the fle≈øh would have remained untill the third day after it was ≈øacrificed, and then might not be eaten, but it mu≈øt be burnt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors te≈øtifie, that the fle≈øh of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Peace-offerings mu≈øt remain but one whole night after it was ≈øacrificed, and ≈øo con≈øequently but one natural morning. <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith thus, By word of mouth we have learned that this is a prohibition for leaving the fle≈øh of the <hi>Cagigah</hi> of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day unto the ≈øixteenth day, as it ≈øaid <hi>[unto the morning]</hi> that is till the morning of the ≈øecond day. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 4. their meanings, that it ≈øhould not be kept untill the beginning
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36425:52"/>
(or untill the morning) of the ≈øixteenth day, which begins at Sun-≈øet; in the≈øe words <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> doth truly, though figuratively, call the Sun-≈øet Evening, the morning, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. This is a my≈øtery that belongs peculiarly to the Ceremonial Law, which the inexpert cannot pre≈øently perceive; the like my≈øtery it is to call the beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day, the morrow, as it is three times over called in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 11, 15, 16. and once more in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. as it is explained in Chap. 4. and it is called their next day in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 62.</p>
               <p>And it is a further my≈øtery al≈øo that the Jews Ceremonial day ≈øhould begin ≈øix hours before the Natural day is ended. As for example, The fifteenth day of <hi>Ni≈øhan</hi> was the fir≈øt day of Unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread, and a high Sabbath, and by their Ceremonial cu≈øtome it began before the Evening of the fourteenth day was ended; for the Pa≈ø≈øeover of the fourteenth day was not fea≈øted on till after Sun-≈øet, namely, not till after the fifteenth day by their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial account was begun, according to the date of the per≈øon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. The≈øe are Riddles to ≈øuch as are not ≈øtudious in the <hi>Jews</hi> cu≈øtomes: They could not keep their Religious Fe≈øtival Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the ≈øame Ceremonial day, for then they mu≈øt have kept them the night before their Sacrifices were offered, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible; therefore the night after their Fe≈øtival Sabbaths, was the proper night of the Sabbaths by Creation, though not by Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for the Ceremonial day, in which the polluted per≈øon mu≈øt be purified again≈øt their fe≈øtival Sabbaths, mu≈øt needs begin the date of their new day before hand; and yet they mu≈øt al≈øo keep the Fe≈øtival Supper appertaining to the Sabbath in the night after, and ≈øo by this means, the Ceremonial day was interwoven with the Natural day for the ≈øeveral re≈øpects already named, and therefore this phra≈øe, It ≈øhall be eaten in the ≈øame day, in which the Sacrifice was offered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 30. mu≈øt not, nor cannot be under≈øtood of the ≈øame Ceremonial day, but it may, and mu≈øt be under≈øtood of the ≈øame Natural day.</p>
               <p>Object. 15. <hi>What need had they to keep their Religious Fea≈øts in the night after the Sabbath? was not the whole day from Sun-≈øet to Sun-≈øet ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> It was not ≈øufficient, becau≈øe they mu≈øt fea≈øt upon their Evening ≈øacrifices, as well as upon their Morning ≈øacrifices, but they could not fea≈øt upon their Evening ≈øacrifices untill after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øet,

becau≈øe many times the Evening ≈øacrifices were not fini≈øhed till Sun-≈øet, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 14. therefore they mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity have the night after as the appointed ≈øea≈øon for the ≈øolemnity of their Religious Suppers; and therefore the Sun-≈øet Evening before was not the beginning of the Natural day, it was but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the new day to the per≈øon purified, he mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity begin his new day then, or el≈øe he could not partake in the ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of their Sacrifices the day following; but the Sun-≈øet Evening after the Sabbath was a natural part of the former day, and the proper Fea≈øt of the Sabbath was then celebrated; and the Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> hath reference to this Cu≈øtome, when he ≈øaith, <hi>Ye ≈øhall have a Song as in the Night, when a holy Solemnity is kept,</hi> I≈øa. 30. 29. for they kept their Religious Suppers till Mid-night, and it is evident that all their Religious Fea≈øts were kept with ≈øongs and with ≈øuch like expre≈ø≈øions of joy in the Me≈ø≈øiah for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>E≈ø.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Judg.</hi> 21. 19, 21. and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect, all kind of ≈øadne≈ø≈øe and mourning was forbidden at their ≈øolemn Fea≈øts, becau≈øe it did prophane that joyful Ordinance, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I confe≈ø≈øe the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do expound the word Morning in this Text to mean day-break, but yet they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo often correct that Expo≈øition, for they ≈øay more than once, that they feared it might be a tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion to continue the time of their ≈øolemne Suppers any longer than till Mid-night.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ≈øay, That not onely the ≈øacrifice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion of Peace-offerings (but of other kinds of ≈øacrifices al≈øo) might be eaten all the night long till break of day; As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, The Nazarites Ram, and the bread that came with it, whether it were the portion of the Prie≈øts, or the portion of the Owners, The≈øe might be eaten all the night long til break of day; and the ≈øame law they ≈øay was for the Sin-offerings, and for the Tre≈øpas-offerings, &amp; for the Peace-offerings of the Congregation, and for the re≈øidue of the Meat-offerings: <hi>All the≈øe</hi> (≈øay the <hi>Hebrew</hi>

               <p>In like ≈øort, they ≈øay of the re≈øidue of the Burnt-offerings, that they might lye burning upon the Altar all the night long untill the morning; that is (≈øay they) till break of day, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9. but yet they do al≈øo correct that Interpretation; for they ≈øay, <hi>Our wi≈øe men have ≈øaid, that the Prie≈øts might not let the fats or peeces of the Burnt-offering lye burning upon the Altar, but untill Mid-night, for fear of Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ≈øay al≈øo, that they might continue fea≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the fle≈øh of the Pa≈øchal Lamb till morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 10. that is (≈øay they) till break of day; but yet they ≈øay al≈øo that none of the company might eat again after he had ≈ølept, though it were in the beginning of the night. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 10. Hence it is evident that they did allow none to make any more but one di≈øtinct meal of the Pa≈øchal Lamb; and truly ≈øo ≈ømall a creature needed not ≈øo long a time to fea≈øt on it (but their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Peace-offerings which they offered with the Pa≈øchal Lamb, and in that re≈øpect did call them the Pa≈ø≈øeover, they might fea≈øt upon that fle≈øh till day-break, for they had two dayes allowance to eat them by the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7<hi>:</hi> 17, 18.) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øeeing they might make but one meal of the Lamb-Pa≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, why ≈øhould any man think of a longer time to fea≈øt on it than till the Mid-night Morning? if it had been requi≈øite to fea≈øt on it till day break, our Saviour would have improved the full time; but it is evident that he did fini≈øh all by Mid-night, not onely the Supper of the Pa≈øchal Lamb, but al≈øo the Peace-offerings, which he adjoyned to the Pa≈øchal Lamb, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 12. (This 12.

I apprehend it was much about the time of Mid-night, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, when he had ended all.</p>
               <p>And it doth further appear that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did fear it might be a Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion to continue at their Religious Fea≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Jews ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the fir≈øt half of the night to be a part of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day in the ca≈øe of their religious Fea≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their Pa≈ø≈øeovers.</note> on the <hi>Pa≈øcha</hi> till the morning at day-break, becau≈øe they do often limit the time of their Religious Fea≈øting, but untill Mid-night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>That the two Lambs which were pre≈øented as a Meat-offering, together with the Two Loaves for the Peace-offerings of the Congregation, on the day of Pentico≈øt, were eaten by the Prie≈øts in the Same Day, and in Half the Night, as the fle≈øh of the mo≈øt Holy things were.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 20. By this Te≈øtimony it is evident, that all their holy things were eaten in the ≈øame day, and in half the night, except their voluntary Peace-offerings, for they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from the Law to fea≈øt on that fle≈øh two dayes, and one night, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17, 18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Con≈øider this well; for though the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do ≈øometimes ≈øay, that the fats and the peeces of the Burnt-offering may lye burning upon the Altar all night till break of day, yet they do al≈øo ≈øay, that their Wi≈øe men did advi≈øe the Prie≈øts not to continue the burning upon the Altar any longer than till Mid-night, and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 8. the Lord ≈øaith, <hi>The fat of my Fea≈øt ≈øhall not remain untill the morning,</hi> therefore it mu≈øt be wholly con≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with fire before day-break.

By this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Canon it is evident that they could not continue the burning of the fats and peeces of the Evening ≈øacrifices untill day-break without tran≈øgre≈ø≈øing this nece≈ø≈øary order in clean≈øing the Altar by way of preparation to the morning ≈øacrifices, for they might not do any other work about the morning ≈øacrifice till the a≈øhes were taken from the Altar, for that was the fir≈øt work in order to the morning ≈øacrifice, and they could not do that work untill the burning of the fats, and of the peeces of the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ≈øacrifices were fini≈øhed; therefore they might not continue the burning any longer than till Mid-night (at ≈øometimes at lea≈øt)

without Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, e≈øpecially in the night before the day of Reconciliation, for then the Prie≈øts mu≈øt take away the a≈øhes from the Altar at Mid-night; and by this it is evident that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors held that the morning (namely the root of it) began at Mid-night, becau≈øe they did then give order to ≈øet things in a readine≈ø≈øe for the morning Sacrifice; and after this work was done, they had many other things to ≈øet in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could offer the morning Sacrifice, and the u≈øual time of killing the morning Sacrifice was before Sun-ri≈øing, but on Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation day it was killed at day-break. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 4. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
               <p>By the≈øe Records of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, we may ≈øee the true Rea≈øon why they feared it might be a Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion to continue the burning any longer than till Mid-night, and why they feared it might be a Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion to continue their Fe≈øtival Suppers any longer than till Mid-night; it was becau≈øe they held the root of the morning to begin at Mid-night; And <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is a Commandement that is done in the hour of the ≈øame.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 10.</p>

               <p>The meaning of the≈øe Pa≈ø≈øages is, That whereas the≈øe things were to be done to day, and might not be put off till to morrow: If they were done any time before Mid-night, it was reputed cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as done to day.</p>
               <p>Their Phylacteries were to be ≈øaid over every day at Even: If they were ≈øaid over before Mid-night, it ≈øerved the turn for the day before.</p>
               <p>And the parts of the Offerings that were to be eaten in the ≈øame day that the Offering was offered (and might not be kept till the morrow) if they were eaten before Mid-night, it did ≈øerve the turn for the day before.</p>
               <p>The Altar of Burnt-offering was to be clean≈øed every day; but on the day of Expiation it began to be clean≈øed from the Mid-night before, and that was taken as done on the day of Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>The≈øe things I have produced the rather, becau≈øe of this pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage in <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 35. which calls it the Morning; and yet it was <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Were I to di≈øcu≈ø≈øe the Que≈øtion about the beginning and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Chri≈øtian Sabbath, I ≈øhould think this matter worth con≈øideration to that purpo≈øe.</p>

               <p>After my long digre≈ø≈øion to an≈øwer ≈øeveral Objections about the <hi>Iews</hi> cu≈øtoms, I come now to ≈øpeak of the ≈øecond part of the Pa≈ø≈øeover Evening, appointed for the time of their religious Fea≈øting on their Pa≈ø≈øeovers, and that was from Sun-≈øet to Mid-night, and this ≈øpace of time was all the latter evening.</p>

               <p>1 <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> appointed all <hi>I≈ørael</hi> to eat the fle≈øh of the Pa≈øchal Lamb [In that Night] <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8, 42. namely in that part of the night that belonged to the fourteenth day by Creation.</p>
               <p>2 It is evident that Chri≈øt did not ≈øit down to eat the Pa≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with his twelve Apo≈øtles, until the latter evening was come; for Chri≈øt him≈øelf was in the fore-noon, or in the beginning of the after-noon at <hi>Bethany,</hi> when he ≈øent two of his Di≈øciples to <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> to prepare the Pa≈ø≈øeover, and to pre≈øent it to the Prie≈øts to be killed for them all between the two evenings, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 3. 12. 13. then after it was ≈øacrificed he bad them carry it to ≈øuch a hou≈øe, and make it ready again≈øt his coming, and in thus doing he did according to the <hi>Iews</hi> cu≈øtom, for their cu≈øtom was, that if thirteen or twenty did joyn together for one Pa≈ø≈øeover, they did ≈øend one or two of their company to pre≈øent it to the Prie≈øt, and ≈øo to make it ready for the re≈øt. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 12. then at Sun-≈øet they all met together, and began the fea≈øt at the hour appointed. This cu≈øtom our Saviour ob≈øerved, for he came not in per≈øon to <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> til the latter evening was come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 20. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 17. and when he was come he did not ≈øit down to eat until the appointed hour was come, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 14. this hour in general was the latter evening at Sun-≈øet, but the particular hour of their fea≈øting was not by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors Canons untill three Stars did appear after Sun-≈øet. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 9.</p>

                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:36425:56"/>
2 It is evident that our Saviour did not begin to Fea≈øt on his Pa≈ø≈øeover untill the ≈øaid evening was come, and it is evident al≈øo, that he fini≈øhed all his religious exerci≈øes and ≈øolemnities within the ≈øpace of this latter evening, from ≈øun-≈øet till mid-night, as I have opened the matter more in my an≈øwer to the ≈øixteenth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>Object. 17. <hi>How can you prove that the Pa≈ø≈øeover-Supper was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the night of the fourteenth day, ≈øeeing you confe≈ø≈øe that the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day began that night at Sun-≈øet; and the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors affirm, that the fle≈øh of the Pa≈øchal Lamb was eaten in the fifteenth night; how then can that night appertain both to the fourteenth, and to the fifteenth day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> It was the fifteenth night, according to the date of the per≈øon purified, as I have opened the matter in chap. 4. and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but in regard of the Fea≈øt it did ≈øtill properly appertain to the fourteenth day. As for example, if a <hi>Iew</hi> were defiled on the Pa≈ø≈øeover day by any of the lighter ≈øorts of uncleane≈ø≈øes, what cour≈øe mu≈øt he take that he might not be deprived of the Pa≈ø≈øeover Fea≈øt? the an≈øwer is, he mu≈øt bathe or bapti≈øe him≈øelf in Water, at the looking forth of the evening, that is to ≈øay, in the after-noon; And what then? might hee then carry his Lamb to the Temple to be ≈øacrificed? No, he might not yet go him≈øelf to the Temple, becau≈øe his clen≈øing was not fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; but yet he might joyn with others, and cau≈øe others to kill the Pa≈ø≈øeover for him, becau≈øe he was now in his fir≈øt degree of clean≈øing, and then as ≈øoon as the Sun was fully gone down upon him he was fully clean, and then he began the date of his day of cleanene≈ø≈øe, and then as ≈øoon as three Stars appeared after Sun-≈øet, he might ≈øit down with the re≈øt of that Society to eat the Pa≈ø≈øeover. See <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
               <p>And thus the Sun-≈øet evening was the fifteenth day to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon purified, and yet it was properly the fourteenth day ≈øtill, in re≈øpect of fea≈øting on the Sacrifices; and thus the≈øe two actions of Fea≈øting and Purifying may wel bear the date of two ≈øeverall days thus enter-woven together, without any confu≈øion or di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It was nece≈ø≈øary that the Per≈øon purified ≈øhould begin the date of his new day as ≈øoon as his Ceremonial cleanene≈ø≈øe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the ≈øetting of the Sun upon him after his Bapti≈øing, as

I have opened the matter in chap. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It was al≈øo as nece≈ø≈øary that the ≈øolemn act of fea≈øting upon the fle≈øh of their Sacrifices ≈øhould bear the date of the ≈øame day with the ≈øaid Sacrifices; 1 Becau≈øe the act of Fea≈øting received no new degree of cleanene≈ø≈øe at Sun-≈øet, as the per≈øon purified did. 2. Becau≈øe the act of fea≈øting in the latter evening after Sun-≈øet had a nece≈ø≈øary dependence upon the act of Sacrificing in the former evening, for the act of fea≈øting on the Holy fle≈øh in the latter evening was but to help on the Spiritual appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that document that was typified and exhibited by the ≈øacrifice in the former evening; therefore ≈øeeing the act of fea≈øting had ≈øuch a nece≈ø≈øary dependence upon the act of ≈øacrificing, I ≈øee no rea≈øon why this continued Sacramental Pa≈ø≈øeover ≈øhould bear the date of two ≈øeveral proper Natural days; I ≈øee no rea≈øon why the act of fea≈øting ≈øhould bear the date of the fifteenth day, except it be only in relation to the date of the per≈øon purified, and thus <hi>Maymony</hi> above cited mu≈øt be under≈øtood, that the fle≈øh of the Pa≈øchal Lamb was eaten on the fifteenth night, namely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the date of the per≈øon purified, though in regard of the Fea≈øt it ≈øelf it was but the fourteenth night ≈øtill, as in my next an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer at fifthly I have cited his words.</p>
               <p>Obj. 18. <hi>I de≈øire to ≈øee yet further, how you can prove that the latter evening at Sun-≈øet was a true part of the fourteenth day in the ca≈øe of their religious Fea≈øting upon the Pa≈ø≈øeover.</hi>

                  </gap>, and yet the Fea≈øt was kept after Sun-≈øet. Hence it follows, that the time of fea≈øting on the Pa≈øchal Lamb after Sun-≈øet was a true part of the fourteenth day by Creation, though it was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36425:57"/>
of the fifteenth day to the per≈øon purified.</p>
               <p>2 It is evident, that the Sun-≈øet evening is a true part of the ≈øame fourteenth day by Creation, by <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 11. In the ≈øecond Month, in the fourteenth day of the Month, between the two evenings they ≈øhall do it, with unleavened Cakes, and bitter Herbs ≈øhall they eat it.</p>
               <p>In this text <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> doth ≈øpeak of a Two-fold action to be done in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month; He ≈øpeaks of doing it, namely according to the Command, that is to ≈øay, of ≈øacrificing it between the two evenings; Secondly, He ≈øpeaks of the act of fea≈øting with unleavened Cakes, and bitter Herbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> doth not di≈øtribute the≈øe two Sacramental actions unto two ≈øeverall Natural days, but commands them both to bee done in the ≈øame fourteenth day of the month.</p>
               <p>3 It is evident by <hi>Jo≈ø.</hi> 10. 3. that they kept the Fea≈øt of the Pa≈øchal Lamb on the fourteenth day of the Month at Even; <hi>Jo≈øhuae</hi> names only the time of Fea≈øting (though the time of Sacrificing mu≈øt be under≈øtood) he ≈øaith plainly, that it mu≈øt be fea≈øted on in the fourteenth day of the Month at even, I cannot ≈øee how any man that loves plain truth can deny the Sun-≈øet evening to be a true part of the former day.</p>
               <p>4 It is evident that the latter evening was a true part of the fourteenth day, becau≈øe the ≈øeven days of unleavened Bread have ≈øeven latter evenings belonging to them, be≈øides the latter evening of the fourteenth day, ≈øo that they ob≈øerved eight fe≈øtival Evenings together, and ≈øo <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> doth number them, in <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. and hence it follows, that the Fe≈øtival Supper which belonged to the la≈øt day of unleavened Bread, which was the one and twentieth day of the Month, did al≈øo bear the date of the two and twentieth day to the per≈øon purified, and this latter evening was the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ≈øea≈øon for all their Holy Fe≈øtival Suppers, and often-times it was little enough, for they mu≈øt boyl and ro≈øt all the fle≈øh of their Peace-offerings, which were of the greater kind, as ≈øheep and Oxen, (for no Fowls were allowed for Peace-offerings. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 3. 6.) this did much increa≈øe the quantity of their Provi≈øions, and therefore it required the longer time both to Cook it, and to fea≈øt on it; and all the≈øe days of Fea≈øting were commanded to be done with great ≈øolemnity, e≈øpecially the fir≈øt and the la≈øt, and with many relations of Gods goodne≈ø≈øe for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36425:57"/>
their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and with Songs and P≈øalms of prai≈øe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 7. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8. and in this re≈øpect the latter evening was a competent time for the≈øe religious Solemnities, and to continue the time of fea≈øting longer, was a tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion: for it is expre≈øly commanded in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. that the holy fle≈øh mu≈øt be eaten in the ≈øame day in which it was ≈øacrificed; But if the Sun-≈øet evening had been the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Natural day, then this Holy fle≈øh could not have been eaten the ≈øame day, as I have noted the rea≈øon thereof for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and then God by <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> had commanded us to do that which is not po≈ø≈øible to be done; therefore the Sun-≈øet evening is a true part of the ≈øame Natural day wherein the fle≈øh was ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith (as I noted in objection ≈øixteen) that the Prie≈øts did eat the two Loaves which were pre≈øented to the Lord with the Meat-offering of the Congregation on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico≈øt, in the ≈øame day, and in half the night, as the fle≈øh of the mo≈øt holy things were. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 20. ≈øo then, in the judgement of the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors (for <hi>Maymony</hi> doth but record their judgement) the latter evening till mid-night was a true part of the ≈øame Natural day, in which the Sacrifices were offered, though yet notwith≈øtanding the purified per≈øon began the date of his new day at the Sun-≈øet afore.</p>
               <p>5 Thus (≈øaith <hi>Maymony)</hi> after he had related divers circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the Pa≈ø≈øeover, then is brought in a Table furni≈øhed with bitter Herbs, unleavened Bread, and the Body of the Pa≈øchal Lamb, and the fle≈øh <hi>Chagigah,</hi> which is (≈øaith he) for the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the Month, he doth not ≈øay which is for the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the Month (though otherwi≈øe he doth call this time the fifteenth day of the Month) both are true in a right ≈øen≈øe, namely in the ≈øen≈øe formerly given) and in another place <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith thus, The evening of the fourteenth of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He makes the time of fea≈øting to belong to the fourteenth day; and ≈øecondly, he preferres this evening to the evening of the Fe≈øtival Sabbaths, and therefore pre≈øcribes a greater puni≈øhment for ≈øervile work done on this evening, than for working in the evening before the Fe≈øtival Sabbaths, for ≈øo is the compari≈øon to be made, as I

have noted it el≈øewhere, becau≈øe in this evening was ≈øolemnized the proper Fea≈øt of the fourteenth day; but the evening before was but in way of preparation to the Sabbath it ≈øelf. Thirdly, <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith thus, They ≈øearched out Leaven in the beginning of the night of the fourteenth day; <hi>Maymony</hi> calls the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fea≈øt of the unleavened Bread the fourteenth night, and yet in another place he calleth it the fifteenth day.</p>
               <p>Thus have I proved, not only by Scripture, but al≈øo by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that the Sun-≈øet evening is a true part of the former day, though it be al≈øo the beginning of a new day to the per≈øon purified, by a Ceremonial in≈øtitution.</p>

               <p>1 Some under≈øtand it of the ≈øacrifice-Evening of the ninth day.</p>
               <p>2 Some under≈øtand it of the Evening at the end of the ninth day where the tenth day begins</p>
               <p n="1">1 In the fir≈øt ≈øen≈øe, <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>They began to afflict their ≈øouls in the Evening of the ninth day, next before the tenth day, and ≈øo they tarried in their affliction a little in the night after the tenth day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the≈øe words you ≈øee that <hi>Maymony</hi> doth not hold this fa≈øt to begin with the tenth day at the Sun-≈øet Evening, according to the date of the new day of the per≈øon purified; but in the evening of the ninth day, next before the tenth day<hi>:</hi> And <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> ≈øaith moreover, <hi>That they mu≈øt abide in their affliction a little in the night after the tenth day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This early beginning, and this late ending of this fa≈øting-day doth increa≈øe the length of this day, beyond the length of any other fa≈øting-day, or of any other Sabbath day.</p>

the next clau≈øe from Even unto Even you ≈øhall Re≈øt your Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; and by this reading, we may ≈øee that the Seventy do make the latter Evening of the ninth day, to be a true part of the ninth day, though it were al≈øo the beginning of the tenth day accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the date of the per≈øon purified.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Hence it is al≈øo evident, that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did not hold the naturall beginning of the tenth day to begin at the Sun-≈øet evening of the ninth day, for then <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> words ≈øhould have run thus, From the tenth of the month from the Evening; but <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> doth not ≈øay ≈øo, but from the ninth of the month from the Evening, either he mu≈øt mean it to begin from the Sacrifice-Evening of the ninth day, as <hi>Maymony</hi> expounds it; or ≈øecondly, from the latter Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ninth day (as a true part of the ninth day) as the Seventy under≈øtand it; or thirdly, from the Ceremonial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ninth day, which begins at the Sun-≈øet Evening before the ninth day. But then,</p>
               <p n="4">4 If you will take this phra≈øe from Even to Even to be from the Evening of the ninth day, according to the date of the per≈øon purified, then all the ninth day mu≈øt be a fa≈øting day as well as the tenth day, for the Evening of the ninth day is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ninth day according to the date of the per≈øon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; but if you de≈øire to avoid this gro≈ø≈øe ab≈øurdity, then you mu≈øt grant that the natural Evening of the ninth day did not begin, but end the ninth day, as the Seventy Interpreters do carry it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 They that do place the natural Evening at the beginning of the ninth day, and yet do allow the Sacrifice Evening to be placed at the end of the ninth day, they do thereby place the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural morning of the ninth day between the two Evenings of the ninth day, and ≈øo they do make the morning Sacrifice to be killed between the two Evenings; but when men will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth in the love of it, it is ju≈øt with God to let them run into ≈øuch ab≈øurd con≈øequences as the≈øe.</p>
               <p n="6">6 This fa≈øting-day was longer than any other fa≈øting-day; for <note place="margin">No fa≈øting-day among the Jews was ≈øo long as the Fa≈øt on the day of Attone<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment was.</note> all other publick fa≈øting dayes were left to the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> to be appointed when≈øoever they were in any di≈øtre≈øs, which were proclamed to be ob≈øerved in all the Synagogues of the Land, as well as at the Temple: But they did not injoyn them to begin tho≈øe fa≈øting dayes in the Evening before, with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36425:59"/>
≈øuch a ≈øtrict ab≈øtinence as they did the day of Reconciliation; for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ≈øay, <hi>That it was lawfull for them to eat in the night, when the fea≈øt was on the morrow.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Nu.</hi> 9. 10. By this te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Maymony,</hi> it is evident that they began all their other ≈øolemn fa≈øting-dayes in the morning, and not in the evening before, except the day of Reconciliation only; therfore no other publick fa≈øting-day was of ≈øuch a length as this yeerly fa≈øting-day was.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Neither was any other Sabbath of ≈øuch a length for ≈øtrict Re≈øt as this fa≈øting-Sabbath was, for they mu≈øt begin the ≈øtrict Re≈øt of this day, either in the Sacrifice Evening of the ninth day, or at the beginning of the latter Evening of the ninth: But they did not begin the ≈øtrict Re≈øt neither of their fe≈øtival Sabbaths, nor of the Sabbath or ≈øeventh day in the Evening before, as they did this yeerly fa≈øting-Sabbath; For <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Such works as may be done on the Evening of a Fea≈øt-day, they do not upon a Fea≈øt-day, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Ain.</hi> in 23. 7. By this te≈øtimony it is evident, that they did not hold the Evening before their fe≈øtival-Sabbaths to be as holy as the day it ≈øelf.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith, It is unlawful to do works in the Evening of the fe≈øtival Sabbaths, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice, and forwards, Even as on the Evenings of the Sabbaths; and who ≈øo doth work in them ≈øhall never ≈øee a ≈øign of a Be≈ø≈øing, and he is to be rebuked, and to be made to leave off by force, though he is not for it to be ≈øcourged or excommunicated, except in the Evening of the Pa≈ø≈øeover after Mid-day who≈øo doth work therein after Mid-day, is to be ≈øcourged, or excommunicated with the <hi>Niddui;</hi> for the Evening of the fourteenth day of <hi>Ni≈øhan,</hi> is not like the Evening of other fe≈øtival dayes, becau≈øe in it are the Fea≈øt, and the killing of Sacrifices. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
               <p>Two things are ob≈øervable from this Record of <hi>Maymony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 That the <hi>Jews</hi> did make ≈øome kind of preparation, both to their fe≈øtival-Sabbaths, and to their Sabbath or ≈øeventh day, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice, and forwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hence it is evident, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did not e≈øteem any part of the Evening before their Sabbaths, to be as holy as the day following, becau≈øe they did neither ≈øcourge, nor excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any man, for working in the Evening before their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, as they did for working in the Pa≈ø≈øeover Evening; and the rea≈øon is plain, becau≈øe they e≈øteemed both the parts of the Pa≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over-Evening
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36425:60"/>
to be the very day of the Pa≈ø≈øeover it ≈øelf; but it ≈øeems they did not e≈øteem the Evening before the Sabbath to be any true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, for doubtle≈ø≈øe, if they had e≈øteemed it as a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, they would not onely have ≈øcourged and excommunicated ≈øuch per≈øons, that did pre≈øume to work in the Evening, before the Sabbath, but al≈øo they would have ≈øtoned them to death, if they had pre≈øumptuou≈øly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the re≈øt of the holy Sabbath, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 35. And as <hi>Maymony</hi> makes the Evening of the Pa≈ø≈øeover, not like the Evening that went before their fe≈øtival Sabbaths, nor like the Evening that went before their weekly Sabbath; So I may ≈øay of the Evening that went before the day of Attonement, that it was more ≈øtrict for holy re≈øt than the Evening that went before any of the other Sabbaths.</p>
               <p>From all the Premi≈øes, I conclude, that no day in all the yeer was commanded to be of ≈øuch a length for ≈øtrict Re≈øt as this day was, for the ≈øtrict Re≈øt of this day, and the ≈øtrict Fa≈øt of this day began in the Sacrifice Evening, or el≈øe at the beginning of the latter Evening of the ninth day, and it continued not onely till a little after the Sun-≈øet Evening of the tenth day, as <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith, But al≈øo it continued longer, for ≈øome of the holy duties of the tenth day, could not be fini≈øhed till Mid-night after; for</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Prie≈øts mu≈øt eat their part of the publick Sin-offering, <hi>Num.</hi> 29. 11. which mu≈øt be eaten in the ≈øame day in which it was offered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 26. (as other Sacrifices were, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15, 18.) and yet the Prie≈øts could not eat the holy fle≈øh of this publick Sin-offering till after Sun-≈øet; for the fa≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> of this day was not fully ended till after Sun-≈øet, and therefore al≈øo they might not begin to Cook that holy fle≈øh untill the Fa≈øt was fully ended. Hence it follows, that the ≈øame day did ≈øtill continue till after Sun-≈øet, yea untill it was Mid-night.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Prie≈øts had another work to do within the limits of this tenth day, namely, they mu≈øt burn all the fats and peeces of all the publick Evening-≈øacrifices of this day (which were many) and ≈øome of their Evening-≈øacrifices were al≈øo offered neer unto Sun-≈øet, and therefore this work and duty of burning would require not only the more diligence, but al≈øo the more time, to fini≈øh this ≈øweet ≈øavor upon the Lords Altar in its own proper day, as I have noted the commanded ≈øea≈øon thereof more at large in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:36425:60"/>
3 It appears, that ≈øome of the works which appertained to the morning-≈øacrifice of this tenth day, mu≈øt begin at Mid-night, and that ≈øome of the works which mu≈øt be done about the Evening-≈øacrifice were ≈øuch as could not be ended untill the Mid-night after.</p>
               <p>For the fir≈øt work that mu≈øt be done on this day in preparation to the Morning-≈øacrifice was the taking away the a≈øhes from the Altar, and the≈øe a≈øhes they mu≈øt begin to take away at Mid-night, as <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 10. And in an other place he ≈øaith, they took away the a≈øhes at Mid-night, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the wood, &amp;c. and at the break of day they began to kill the daily Morning-≈øacrifice. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
               <p>In like ≈øort they could not fini≈øh the burning of all the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-≈øacrifices of this day till Mid-night, as I have ≈øhewed above from <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9. and yet over and above this full day from Mid-night to Mid-night, they began their ≈øtrict Fa≈øt, and their ≈øtrict Re≈øt, in the Evening of the ninth day, which did increa≈øe the length of this day to be an extraordinary long Fa≈øting-Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude, That the beginning of this day cannot be alleged as an exemplary pattern, neither for the beginning of any other Fa≈øting-day, nor yet for the beginning of our Lords day, as it is intended by tho≈øe that allege it for the beginning and ending of the <hi>Jews</hi> weekly Sabbath from Even to Even.</p>

                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> This expo≈øition of the beginning of the Sun-≈øet evening, and of the beginning of the Sabbath, is a new-found devi≈øe, I have already ≈øhewed the vanity of it in Chapter 4. in my an≈øwer to Obj. 2. That the Sun-≈øet evening is truly come as ≈øoon as ever the Body of the Sun is gone out of fight, and that Darkne≈ø≈øe is then begun, becau≈øe the ≈øhining of the Sun is gone from off the face of the earth, and Darkne≈ø≈øe is ≈øaid to begin at the going down of the Sun, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 17. and then the <hi>Jews</hi> began to ≈øet their Night-watches, and then the purified per≈øon began the date of the day of his cleanene≈ø≈øe, and therefore if the Sabbath it ≈øelf did begin in the evening at all, it began then, namely according to the date of the day of the purified per≈øon, which began as ≈øoon as ever the Body of the Sun was gone out of ≈øight, as I have ≈øhewed in chap. 4. and then if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not ≈øet a Watch at the Gates of <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> till the darkne≈ø≈øe in the Skie was more than the light in the Skie, he did not that which was ≈øufficient to pre≈øerve the Holy re≈øt of the Holy Sabbath, e≈øpecially ≈øeeing they began to make ≈øome preparation to the ob≈øervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice before, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors.</p>

               <p>I grant that formerly I have expounded this clau≈øe in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not let his Carka≈ø≈øe hang all night upon the tree,</hi> to mean (not at all in the night) but ≈øince then I finde upon better examination that I was in an error, though Ma≈øter <hi>Norton</hi> takes it for a truth, and ≈øo in like ≈øort he takes ≈øome plain truths for great errors; but this ≈øentence, they ≈øhal not hang all night, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that they may hang ≈øome part of the night upon the tree, provided they were buried the ≈øame day, namely in the ≈øame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural day, which la≈øted after Sun-≈øet untill Mid-night, as I have ≈øhewed in chap. 5. in my an≈øwer to Object. 16.</p>

               <p>The chief Prie≈øts were fir≈øt in their reque≈øt to <hi>Pilate,</hi> becau≈øe it was the time of their preparation to their ≈øolemn High Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Supper, for it was the fir≈øt day of unleavened bread, which was a high Sabbath, and their Fe≈øtival-Supper was to begin at Star-light, therefore they be≈øought <hi>Pilate</hi> that their leggs might be broken, and that they might be taken away, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 31. thus you ≈øee that the Prie≈øts in regard of their preparation to their Sabbath-Supper were fir≈øt in their reque≈øt unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> pre≈øently upon this <hi>Pilate</hi> commanded that their leggs ≈øhould be broken, and <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> perceiving their reque≈øt, fir≈øt did wi≈øely e≈øpy the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of time, and without delay he went boldly unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> and be≈øought him, that he might take away the Body of Je≈øus, and <hi>Pilate</hi> gave him leave; he came therefore and took the Body of Je≈øus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 38. this was all done in the neck of one another, and this time is recorded by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> to be when the Sun-≈øet evening was done.</p>
               <p>From the Premi≈øes I rea≈øon thus; If the Sun-≈øet evening was come before <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> went to <hi>Pilate</hi> to begge the Body of Chri≈øt, then the Sabbath Star might well be ri≈øen before the Body of Chri≈øt could be inclo≈øed in the heart of the earth, for <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> had many things to do after he had the grant of the dead Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could be inclo≈øed in his Grave; Fir≈øt, he went to the Shops to buy ≈øeverall peeces of Linnen to wrap the dead Body in, according to the <hi>Iews</hi> manner, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 6, 7. (as we may ≈øee the manner in <hi>Lazarus</hi> burial, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 44.) and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> al≈øo did take up ≈øome time to imbalm his Body, which al≈øo was done with many circum≈øtances according to the <hi>Iews</hi> cu≈øtome, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 40. (as it is ≈øet down by Mr. <hi>Ain≈øworth</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 4. and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 2.) and then (though the place of burial were near, yet) it would require both hands and time to carry him thither, and to rowl the ≈øtone upon the mouth of his Grave, before hee could be ≈øaid to be inclo≈øed in the heart of the earth; I grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:36425:63"/>
that all this was done with as much ha≈øte as might be, becau≈øe of the <hi>Iews</hi> preparation to their Fe≈øtival Supper, and yet as ≈øoon as this was done, or could be done, their High Fe≈øtival-Sabbath began to lighten, namely, with the Evening Star at lea≈øt, if not with more Stars, for it was a Canon among them, not to begin their Fe≈øtival-Suppers till three Stars did appear, and doubtle≈ø≈øe <hi>Lukes</hi> phra≈øe doth allude to that cu≈øtom. This Sabbath that did now begin to lighten was not the Sabbath it ≈øelf, for if the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath it ≈øelf had been begun at the ri≈øing of the Evening Starre, then doubtle≈ø≈øe the holy Women had broken the holy re≈øt of the Sabbath day, becau≈øe after all this they went to the ≈øhops and bought Odors, and Oyntments, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 56. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 1. yea and after they had bought the≈øe Odors and Oyntments they went home and prepared them in a readine≈ø≈øe to perfume the Body of Chri≈øt with them as ≈øoon as ever the Sabbath was pa≈øt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 1. If they had bought them before his burial they would have perfumed his Body before his burial, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Therefore ≈øeeing the≈øe holy Women did all this work after the burial, and after the Sabbath began to lighten, it is an evident proof that the Sabbath it ≈øelf did not begin neither at the Sun-≈øet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the per≈øon purified began the date of his new day, nor yet at the ri≈øing of the evening ≈øtarre, for if the Sabbath it ≈øelf had been begun at either of the≈øe times, then the holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had mo≈øt gro≈øly broken the holy re≈øt of the Sabbath; But the Holy Text doth witne≈ø≈øe on their ≈øide that they re≈øted the Sabbath, according to the Commandment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 56.</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude from this practi≈øe of the holy Women, that though the evening before the Sabbath doth bear the date of the day following to the per≈øon purified, yet in proper ≈øpeaking it is no part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, it is only to be e≈øteemed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath but by way of preparation, and no more.</p>
               <p>Secondly I an≈øwer, That your expo≈øition of the word before may better carry this ≈øen≈øe, namely that this latter evening was indeed before the Sabbath it ≈øelf, and I have ≈øhewed in chap. 5. that the evening of the Sabbath is put by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, ≈øometimes for the evening before the Sabbath, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the la≈øt half of the Sabbath it ≈øelf; but ≈øee more in this Chapter in the an≈øwer to the next objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:36425:63"/>Object. 2. <hi>It ≈øeems to me that the Sabbath it ≈øelf did begin and end at the Sun-≈øet Evening by the</hi> Jews <hi>practi≈øe, for they held it unlawful before the Sun-≈øet Evening was come for our Saviour to heal di≈øea≈øed per≈øons; But after the Sun-≈øet Evening was come, all manner of di≈øea≈øed per≈øons came flocking to him for cure,</hi> Mar. 1. 32. <hi>Hence it appears that the</hi> Jews <hi>held the Sabbath to be fully ended as ≈øoon as the Sun-≈øet Evening was come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> It is but the bare conjecture that they forbore to bring their ≈øick per≈øons till the Sabbath was ended: I deny it to be the very rea≈øon, I beleeve the onely rea≈øon why they came no ≈øooner, was becau≈øe they had no ≈øooner intelligence of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power to heal; you do barely affirm that the <hi>Jews</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral held it unlawful for our Saviour to heal di≈øea≈øed per≈øons upon the Sabbath day, but you are deceived. <hi>Tremelius</hi> doth te≈øtifie from the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors that they held the contrary: They held that the perill of life did drive away the Sabbath; that is to ≈øay, they held it lawful to u≈øe any means to prevent the danger of death upon the Sabbath day. See <hi>Tremelius</hi> his <hi>Annot.</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 8. in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Te≈øtament; Mr. <hi>Ain≈øworth</hi> al≈øo doth affirm from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that they held it to be a Sabbath days work to vi≈øit the ≈øick; for they held that perill of life did drive away the Sabbath. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10. See al≈øo my former Treati≈øe.</p>
               <p>2 I do al≈øo apprehend by the circum≈øtances of the ≈øtory, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Capernaum</hi> were not offended with our Saviour for his miraculous cure, which he did upon that Sabbath day (as the malignant Scribes and Phari≈øees ≈øometimes were) in healing one in the Synagogue that had an unclean ≈øpirit, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 27.</p>
               <p>3 They took no offence at him for the curing of <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother of her Feavor, pre≈øently after he had left the ≈øaid Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, v 31. Therefore ≈øeeing they found no fault with Chri≈øt for neither of the≈øe miraculous cures before the Sabbath was ended, doubtle≈øs they did not forbear to bring their di≈øea≈øed per≈øons in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of the Sabbath (for they admired the power of God in the≈øe miracles) and therefore as ≈øoon as the publick exerci≈øe was ended, they ≈øpread his fame, ver≈øe 28. and thereupon a multitude of the di≈øea≈øed per≈øons of <hi>Capernaum</hi> came to him for cure with all the po≈ø≈øible ≈øpeed they could, as it appears by their earne≈øt pre≈ø≈øing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:36425:64"/>
after ≈øo ≈øhort a warning, for I conceive by the circum≈øtances of the ≈øtory, that it was but a little afore Sun-≈øet when Chri≈øt left the Synagogue, and then as ≈øoon as he had left the Synagogue he healed <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother, which was another procuring cau≈øe that made the greater flocking to him; but if his miraculous cures had been done ≈øooner, doubtle≈ø≈øe the fame thereof would have made the ≈øick per≈øons to have flocked ≈øooner after him.</p>
               <p>I grant that ≈øome of the malignant Scribes and Phari≈øees did ≈øometimes take offence at Chri≈øt for his miraculous healing upon the Sabbath day; But the people in general rejoyced at all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things that were done by him upon the Sabbath day, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 17. for Chri≈øt did now heal a poor crooked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man upon that Sabbath day, ver≈øe 11. And when the Ruler of the Synagogue took offence at it, Chri≈øt (by rea≈øons) put him to ≈øilence; and the people rejoyced that Chri≈øt had put him to ≈øilence.</p>
               <p>Therefore though ≈øome of the malignant <hi>Jews</hi> held erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly that Chri≈øt ought not to heal upon the Sabbath day, yet that is no good argument to prove that the≈øe <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Capernaum</hi> did purpo≈øely detain their ≈øick per≈øons till the Sabbath was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I deny it to be the Rea≈øon; I do apprehend rather that they did ha≈øtily flock to him, rather than deliberately forbear till the Sabbath might be ended.</p>
               <p>4 Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> on this place ≈øaith, That this Evening was the Evening of the ≈øame day wherein Chri≈øt had done ≈øo much before, as the inference ≈øhews plainly.</p>
               <p>5 It is evident to me from ≈øeveral te≈øtimonies of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that they held the Sun-≈øet Evening after the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, becau≈øe they held it lawful to <note place="margin">The Hebrew Doctors held the Sun-≈øet Evening after the Sabbath, to be a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf.</note> do many things in the Sun-≈øet Evening before the Sabbath, which they did not hold lawfull to be done in the Sun-≈øet Evening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith thus, <hi>The two Loaves of New Corn for the Wave-offering</hi> (on the day of Pentico≈øt) <hi>were not Baked on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teco≈øt, becau≈øe it was a Sabbath; nor in the Evening before, if it were a Sabbath.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 17.</p>
               <p>Two things are evident from this Te≈øtimony.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That in the judgement of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors the Sun-≈øet
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36425:64"/>
Evening after the Sabbath, was a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, becau≈øe they held it unlawfull to bake the ≈øaid two Loaves of new corn in the Evening before the day of Pentico≈øt, if it were a Sabbath: But they might without ≈øcruple have baked the ≈øaid two Loaves in the ≈øaid Evening before Pentico≈øt, as well as on any other Evening, if they had held that the Sabbath had then been fully ended. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hence it is evident, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did not hold the Evening before the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, no otherwi≈øe than by way of preparation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Mamony</hi> gives another in≈øtance from the time of baking the twelve Loaves of Shew-bread; he ≈øaith, <hi>That the twelve Loaves of the Shew-bread might not be baked on the Sabbath, nor on a Fea≈øt-day, but in the Evening of the Sabbath they baked it, and ≈øet it in order on the morrow.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 5.</p>
               <p>Hence this is remarable in this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Record; That he makes a manife≈øt difference between the Evening that goes before the Sabbath, and the Sabbath it ≈øelf, he calls the Evening before, [the Evening of the Sabbath] by cu≈øtome peculiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the date of the new day to the per≈øon purified (as I have formerly ≈øhewed) he allows the≈øe twelve Loaves to be baked in the Evening of the Sabbath all the yeer long, except it fell out to be in the latter Evening of a Fe≈øtival-Sabbath; and therefore it doth hence follow, that not the Evening before, but the Evening after their Fe≈øtival-Sabbaths, was a true part of their Fe≈øtival-Sabbaths; And ≈øo likewi≈øe <hi>Tremelius</hi> a Chri≈øtian <hi>Jew,</hi> doth make the Evening after the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, in his Tran≈ølation and note on the <hi>Syriak</hi> Te≈øtament in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 1.</p>
               <p>Therefore by the judgement of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, the Fe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val-Sabbath was not ended at Sun-≈øet; and thence it follows, that if their fe≈øtival-Sabbaths were not ended at Sun-≈øet, then their weekly Sabbaths were not ended at Sun-≈øet.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith thus, <hi>Who ≈øo laboureth in the Evening of the Sabbath, he ≈øhall eat in the Sabbath,</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that in the judgement of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Canons, the Evening before the Sabbath was no part of the Sabbath no otherwi≈øe but by way of preparation to the Sabbath; for they ≈øay, That he that will eat in the Sabbath, mu≈øt labour in the Evening of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36425:65"/>
the Sabbath, namely in the Evening before the Sabbath; This they ≈øpeak, as I conceive, of their laborious preparing of their Manna (according to every ones palat) in a readine≈øs again≈øt the Sabbath; for though the Manna was a ready food of it ≈øelf, without prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ≈øome ≈øtomacks, yet not to al, til it were cooked to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat; and it could not be prepared in this ≈øort without great labor, for it was ground in Mills, and beaten in Mortars, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 8 And in that re≈øpect the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ≈øay, Who ≈øo laboureth in the Evening of the Sabbath, ≈øhall eat in the Sabbath; but in ca≈øe they neglected this work in the Evening of the Sabbath, they might not do it on the Sabbath day, but they mu≈øt rather fa≈øt and endure hunger for their negligence ≈øake.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that the Evening before, was called the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath, no otherwi≈øe but by way of preparation, and it is called the Evening of the Sabbath from their new date to the per≈øon purified; his new day did ever begin at the Sun-≈øet Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Maymony</hi> ≈øaith thus, <hi>Such works as may be done in the Evening before a Fea≈øt-day they do not upon a Fea≈øt-day; they may not reap, nor thre≈øh, nor winnow, nor grinde corn, nor the like upon a Sabbath day, for all the≈øe things may be done in the Evening of a Sabbath, killing of Bea≈øts, baking of bread, kneading of dough, and the like, may be done in the Evening of a Sabbath.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 7. in like ≈øort their laborious preparation of their Manna mu≈øt be done in the Evening of the weekly Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>By the Evening of the Sabbath the</hi> Jews <hi>do not mean onely the Sun-≈øet Evening, but they accounted the Sabbath Evening to begin at three a clock in the afternoon before; and in this re≈øpect</hi> Maymony <hi>≈øaith thus, It is unlawful to do works in the Evenings of the Fe≈øtival-Sabbaths from the time of the Evening ≈øacrifice, and forward (even as upon the Evening of the weekly Sabbaths) and who ≈øo doth work in them ≈øhall never ≈øee a ≈øign of ble≈ø≈øing, and he is to be rebuked, and to be made to leave off by force, Though he is not for it to be ≈øcourged or excommunicated, except in the Evening of the Pa≈ø≈øeover after Mid-day; who ≈øo doth work therein after Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he is to be ≈øcourged or excommunicated with the Niddui, for the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Ni≈øhan is not like the Evening of other Fe≈øtival dayes, becau≈øe in it are the Fea≈øt, and the killing of Sacrifices.</hi> See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I grant that the <hi>Jews</hi> did make ≈øome kind of preparation
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36425:65"/>
both to their Fe≈øtival-Sabbaths, and to their weekly Sabbaths al≈øo, from the time of the Evening-≈øacrifice, and forwards, till Bed-time; for though they did not begin their day of cleanne≈ø≈øe till Sun-≈øet, yet in regard of the many works that were to be done again≈øt their Fea≈øt-dayes (which I have immediately named) and in regard of preparing their Manna, &amp;c. again≈øt the Sabbath, their wi≈øe men held it convenient to forbear, and leave off the ordinary works of their calling from the time of the Evening-≈øacrifice, and forwards, till bed-time; and in that re≈øpect the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrates them≈øelves did forbear to ≈øit in their Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature after the time of the Evening-≈øacrifice. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 22. But this degree of preparation had no other command from God, but the general rule of conveniency.</p>
               <p>2 It is evident from the ≈øaid Te≈øtimony, that they did not e≈øteem any part of the Evening, neither before, nor after Sun-≈øet, to be as a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, becau≈øe they did neither ≈øcourge nor excommunicate any man that did any ≈øervile work in this Evening, as they did for working in any part of the Pa≈ø≈øeover Evening from Mid-day till Mid-night; but if they had in their judgement e≈øteemed any part of the Evening before the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, doubtle≈ø≈øe they would have puni≈øhed ≈øuch Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors more ≈øeverely than for working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pa≈ø≈øeover Evening, for by <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> Law, ≈øuch per≈øons ought to be ≈øtoned to death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 34, 35.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows fir≈øt, That the Evening before the Sabbath (though it be called the Evening of the Sabbath according to their ceremonial cu≈øtome, yet it) was no true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, but in way of preparation onely.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Sun-≈øet Evening after the Sabbath was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf.</p>
               <p>5 It is evident that the Evening after the Sabbath was e≈øteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, by the te≈øtimony of the Evangeli≈øt <hi>John,</hi> in Chap. 20. 19. the Text runs thus, <hi>The ≈øame day at Evening, being the fir≈øt day of the week; John</hi> calls this Evening not the ≈øecond, but the fir≈øt day of the week, and yet it mu≈øt needs be now a good ≈øpace after Sun-≈øet, for there were two Di≈øciples now pre≈øent that came from <hi>Emaus,</hi> and it was towards Evening before they came from <hi>Emaus,</hi> and they could not well come from thence to <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> in le≈ø≈øe than three hours ≈øpace, for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36425:66"/>
it was ≈øixty Furlongs from <hi>Emaus</hi> to <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> Luke 24. 13. 29. 36.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and others, allow eight Furlongs to an <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> mile; but the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors allow but ≈øeven Furlongs and a half to an <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> mile. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. The New Te≈øtament doth not follow the <hi>Italian</hi> Furlong, but the <hi>Greek</hi> Furlong (or <hi>≈øtadium Olympicum)</hi> which contains ≈øix thou≈øand feet; and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ≈øay that two thou≈øand Cubits make a mile. See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 29. The New Te≈øtament doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Greek</hi> Cu≈øtomes as frequently as they followed the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; Therefore in rea≈øon as the New Te≈øtament was written in <hi>Greek,</hi> ≈øo it ≈øhould follow the <hi>Greek ≈øtadium</hi> rather than the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> be≈øides, I conceive that the <hi>Italian stadium</hi> came not into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon u≈øe untill after the New Te≈øtament was written. So then by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors account, it was eight miles from <hi>Emaus</hi> to <hi>Jeru≈øalem;</hi> that is to ≈øay, it was <hi>Eight Engli≈øh</hi> miles: Now if you will allow but three hours time for the going of the≈øe eight miles, it mu≈øt needs be after Sun-≈øet when they came to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles; and after they were come, they ≈øpent ≈øome time in relating unto the Apo≈øtles what had happened to them the ≈øame day as they went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> and as they were making this Relation Je≈øus came and ≈øtood in the mid≈øt of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 36.</p>
               <p>The≈øe circum≈øtances con≈øidered, it mu≈øt needs be after the date of the <hi>Jews</hi> Ceremonial day before Chri≈øt came in among them, and yet the Evangeli≈øt calls this time of the Evening, the ≈øame day in which Chri≈øt ro≈øe from the dead; and ≈øecondly, he calls it the fir≈øt day of the week. So then, by the≈øe two expre≈ø≈øions the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeli≈øt puts the matter out of doubt to ≈øuch as will be ≈øatisfied by plain con≈øequences of Scripture, that this latter Evening when Chri≈øt came into the hou≈øe to the Apo≈øtles, was a true part of the former day, and yet it was after Sun-≈øet, and therefore it was after their Ceremonial day was begun.</p>
               <p>6 And la≈øtly, I may well bring hither all tho≈øe five Arguments which I alleged in Chap. 5. to prove the latter Evening of the fourteenth day of <hi>Ni≈øhan</hi> to be a true part of the fourteenth day, and therefore it follows by good con≈øequence, hat the latter Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sabbath was a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>It appears to me that the Natural day begins at the Sun-≈øet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for the Lord telleth</hi> Ezekiel <hi>in the ninth year of</hi> Jeconiahs <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi>

                  <hi>that he ≈øhould be dumb untill the day that</hi> Jeru≈øalem <hi>≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed, and untill a Me≈ø≈øenger ≈øhould come to</hi> Ezekiel <hi>to tell the news thereof,</hi> Ezek. 24. 26, 27. <hi>this is the Prediction, now the accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Prophecy is ≈øet down in</hi> Eze. 33. 21, 22. <hi>In the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth Month, and in the fifth day of the Month, then one that had e≈øcaped out of</hi> Jeru≈øalem <hi>came unto</hi> Ezekiel, and ≈øaid, <hi>The City is ≈ømitten; now ≈øaith</hi> Ezekiel, <hi>The hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening before he that had e≈øcaped came, and had opened my mouth untill he came to me in the morning, and when he had opened my mouth I was no more dumb. From the≈øe two Scriptures compared it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the evening before the Me≈ø≈øenger came, and the morning after he was come, are termed the ≈øame day; therefore it follows by good con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that the ≈øame day began in the evening.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> This is a ≈øtrange collection to prove the evening to be the beginning of the Natural day; the vanity of this collection will appear by the opening of two words in this Prophecy, which mu≈øt not be taken as you do, in ≈øtrict propriety of ≈øpeech, but in a figurative ≈øen≈øe, I mean the word Day, and the word Dumb.</p>
               <p>1 I ≈øay the word Day mu≈øt not be taken in a ≈øtrict ≈øen≈øe for a proper Natural day of twenty four hours, but it mu≈øt be taken Figuratively for a time to come, as it appears by the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time; for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ≈øaid to be dumb in the ninth year of <hi>Jeconiahs</hi> captivity, in the tenth Month, and in the tenth day of the Month, <hi>Eze.</hi> 24. 1, 2. in which day <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wi≈øe dyed, ver≈ø. 18. which was the plea≈øure of his eyes, ver≈ø. 16. and her death was for a ≈øign unto the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the Temple which was the plea≈øure of their eyes, ver≈ø. 21. ≈øhould be de≈øtroyed) and then in that day (namely when the Temple ≈øhould be de≈øtroyed, he that e≈øcapeth in that day ≈øhould come to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and tell him; And in <hi>[that day]</hi> viz. in time to come, <hi>Ezekiels</hi> mouth ≈øhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto him which e≈øcaped to tell him, and then he ≈øhould ≈øpeak and be no more dumb, ver. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>This is the Prediction; now compare the ≈øtory of events, and that lyes thus, The Temple was burnt on the tenth day of the fifth Month, in the eleventh year of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Jer. 52. 12, 13. and there is no record to be found that any Me≈ø≈øenger came to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to tell him in the ≈øame day, neither is it po≈ø≈øible for any man to come from <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> to <hi>Chaldea</hi> in one Natural day of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36425:67"/>
twenty four hours, therefore the Me≈ø≈øenger that came to him in <hi>(that day)</hi> came to him in that day which is Figuratively put for the time to come, for the Me≈ø≈øenger came not to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> until ≈øeventeen Months after that the Temple was de≈øtroyed, for hee came not till the fifth day of the tenth Month, and in the twelfth year of <hi>Jeconias</hi> captivity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 21. therefore this phra≈øe the ≈øame day mu≈øt not be under≈øtood of the ≈øame Natural day, but of day at large, for the term day is often put for a large time to come, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 38, 39. &amp; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 12. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 2 See <hi>Ain≈ø.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ≈øaid to be dumb in the ninth year, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 12. 27. till the Me≈ø≈øenger came to him in the twelfth year of <hi>Ieconiahs</hi> captivity, in all which ≈øpace <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was not dumb from ordinary ≈øpeech (as <hi>Zachary</hi> was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 20.) neither yet was he dumb from Prophecying again≈øt other Nations, as it appears by <hi>Eze.</hi> 26. 1. and <hi>Eze.</hi> 29. 1. and <hi>Eze.</hi> 31. but he was dumb or ≈øilent from Prophecying any more again≈øt the unbeleeving <hi>Iews,</hi> as chap. 3. 26. untill this Me≈ø≈øenger came with ≈øpecial tidings, to certifie him how all things were accompli≈øhed as he had fore-told, and now at the coming of this ≈øpecial Me≈ø≈øenger <hi>Ezekiels</hi> mouth was opened again, to utter another Prophecy of the utter ruine of the remnant of the <hi>Iews</hi> that were left, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 2, 3. and from this time forth he was no more dumb; that is to ≈øay, he was no more re≈øtrained from Prophecying to them of their utter ruine: So then, this Me≈ø≈øenger was ≈øent to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, to tell him the pre≈øent ≈øtate of things, and to inquire of him what ≈øhould be the future event of the remnant that were left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> could not chu≈øe but hear of the burning of the Temple long before this Me≈ø≈øenger came to him, partly by the poor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and partly by the Souldiers, and al≈øo he could not chu≈øe but hear of the death of <hi>Gedaliah</hi> before this ≈øpecial Me≈ø≈øenger came; but ≈øuch accidental tidings did not an≈øwer to the ≈øign that was given for the time of his new Prophecying, for the ≈øign was this, That a ≈øpecial Me≈ø≈øenger ≈øhould be ≈øent unto him from <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> to <hi>Chaldea (in a day)</hi> that is to ≈øay in a time to come, and then <hi>Ezekiels</hi> mouth ≈øhould be opened unto him, to utter ≈øome new Prophecy to him, though it was not according to their expectation; for he fore-tels, that the remnant that were left ≈øhould likewi≈øe come to de≈øtruction.</p>

Evening before the Me≈ø≈øenger came, may be taken as well for the fir≈øt, as for the latter Evening; for God did often give Vi≈øions to his Prophets in the fir≈øt Evening, at the time of the Evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 3, 9.

               <p>So then from all the premi≈øes, I conclude, that not the Evening before, but the Evening after the Sabbath was a true part of the Sabbath it ≈øelf, and therefore they that take liberty to bu≈øie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves about worldly matters in the Sun-≈øet Evening after the Sabbath, do prophane that holy time that God hath ≈øanctified to his own u≈øe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Proving that the punctual time of Chri≈øts Re≈øurrection was in the morning, ju≈øt at Sun-ri≈øing.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>DOubtle≈ø≈øe it is a matter of nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence, not onely to prove cleerly the punctual time of Chri≈øts burial, but of his Re≈øurrection al≈øo; for if the time of his Re≈øurrection be uncertain, how can a doubting con≈øcience be ≈øatisfied that Chri≈øt lay three dayes in the heart of the earth, according to the Prediction? Therefore as I have proved the time of Chri≈øts bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to be fini≈øhed when their Fe≈øtival-Sabbath began to lighten by the Evening-≈øtar, ≈øo I ≈øay al≈øo that the time of his Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was ju≈øt about the time of Sun-ri≈øing on the fir≈øt day of the week.</p>
               <p>Chri≈øt did not ri≈øe from his grave before day-break, as ≈øome would have it, nor at day-break, as others would have it, by uncertain gue≈ø≈øes. <hi>Matthew</hi> ≈øaith, that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> went out of the door of her hou≈øe in the fir≈øt day of the week when it began to dawn, intending to perfume his burial with the ≈øweet Odors that ≈øhe had prepared in the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sabbath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 1. But <hi>Mark</hi> ≈øaith, That the Sun was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36425:68"/>
ju≈øt ri≈øen when ≈øhe came to the Sepulchre, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 1. ≈øhe ≈øpent all that ≈øpace of time between day-break and Sun-ri≈øing, partly in calling upon other holy women to go with her, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 10. and partly in going ≈øo much ground as was from her lodging to the Sepulchre, and then when ≈øhe was come to the Sepulchre, there was a mighty Earthquake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 2. and then his grave was opened; ≈øuch a like Earthquake there was at the death of Chri≈øt, which opened divers of the graves of the Saints, and after the Re≈øurrection of Chri≈øt, they did ri≈øe al≈øo out of their graves, and came into the holy City, and appeared unto many, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 52, 53. By this Earthquake at Sun-ri≈øing when <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> came to the Sepulchre, it is evident that Chri≈øt did not ri≈øe out of his grave untill the≈øe holy women came to be witne≈ø≈øes of the time of his Re≈øurrection. I confe≈ø≈øe that many Interpreters do think that Chri≈øt was ri≈øen before the≈øe holy Witne≈ø≈øes came to the Sepulchre, but ≈øuch conjectures may not be admitted, for it is a point of nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence to be proved, That Chri≈øt lay three dayes in the heart of the Earth; but if you ≈øay, That Chri≈øt was ri≈øen before the≈øe holy Witne≈ø≈øes came, then you cannot cleerly prove that Chri≈øt lay three dayes in the heart of earth; for it may be demanded how long was he ri≈øen before they came? If you ≈øay it was but one hour before, I may as well ≈øay it was ≈øeven or eight hours before, and then how can you ≈øatisfie a doubting con≈øcience that Chri≈øt lay three dayes, and three nights in the heart of the earth? I cannot think that Chri≈øt would ≈øuffer his own Prediction to remain ≈øo ob≈øcure without manife≈øt proof of the full accompli≈øhment of it: Therefore I conclude, that Chri≈øt ro≈øe not out of his grave till the holy women came to be Witne≈ø≈øes of the ≈øame, which was al≈øo evidently declared unto them by this Earth-quake at their coming to the Sepulchre, ju≈øt at Sun-ri≈øing, though they could not make that u≈øe of it till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>This Earthquake might be pa≈øt before the holy women came to the Sepulchre, and they might know it afterward only by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers relation.</hi>

                  <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Chri≈øt did never ≈øhew him≈øelf to any wicked man after his Re≈øurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20, 22. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 41. Therefore it is not like that he would make the Roman Souldiers to be the only Witne≈ø≈øes of this Earthquake which did evidence the time

of his Re≈øurrection. I conceive the holy women would not give much credit to the te≈øtimony of the Roman Souldiers, except this Earthquake had been general to all the parts of the City, as wel as to that particular place, but it ≈øeems to me that this Earthquake was not generally ≈øpread over the City, but it was limited only to that particular place where Chri≈øts Sepulchre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>From all the premi≈øes it is evident, that Chri≈øt lay in the heart of the earth about four hours of the ≈øixth day, and the whole Sabbath, and about five hours of the fir≈øt day of the week, namely, from Mid-night till Sun-ri≈øing; and after this ≈øort Chri≈øt lay three dayes, and three nights, in the heart of the Earth.</p>
               <p>But tho≈øe that begin the Sabbath at the Sun-≈øet-Evening can never prove that Chri≈øt lay three dayes in the heart of the Earth: Therefore that opinion mu≈øt needs be of evill con≈øequence: Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe it fal≈øifies the ≈øaid Prediction. And ≈øecondly, Becau≈øe it leads men to do ≈øervile works in the latter Evening
