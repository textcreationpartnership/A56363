            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To the end they might abſtain from their own Worldly imployments in the Lords own Sanctified time.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His point is the more difficult to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed, becauſe I have not met with any beaten road from other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters.</p>
            <p>But I have laboured to make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the Sanctified and ſeparated time of the Lords Day is juſt according to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I have laboured to make it evident, That the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day begins with the Morning.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the Natural morning begins at Mid-night.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That the Natural day, and ſo conſequently the Lords Day, doth begin with the Natural morning, and doth end with the Natural evening at Mid-night.</p>
            <p>And for the want of the knowledge of theſe things, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:36425:3"/>
that many godly perſons do the works of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Callings in ſome part of the Lords ſanctified and ſeparated day, as thoſe do that begin and end the Lords Day at the Sun-ſet Evening, and for their better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I forced my ſelf to compoſe this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>I finde that the chief ground of their error do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h ariſe, Firſt, from a miſtaken interpretation of the firſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be a full Night of twelve hours; and Secondly, from a miſtaken interpretation of the word Evening, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they apprehend it to bee nothing elſe but a full Night.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſundry ſuch like miſtakes, I conceive I have cleared, I preſum'd therefore that this inſuing Treatiſe will be heartily welcome to every tender Conſcience, that doth truly deſire to give unto the Lord his own ſeparated and ſanctified time.</p>
            <p>Many godly Chriſtians, to my knowledge, have been much exerciſed in their Studies, and Meditations, to finde out the true limits of the Lords Day, that ſo they might abſtain from the works of their particular Calling, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of that ſanctified and ſeparated time, from the beginning of the day to the full end thereof.</p>
            <p>For their ſakes alſo, and at the ſpecial requeſt of ſome of them, I have laboured in this Treatiſe, to prove, That all the time of the firſt Darkneſſe was comprehended in the word Morning at laſt, and that it took its beginning from the Mid-night at laſt, namely, as ſoon as all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the Natural day were ſhaped and ſet into their order.</p>
            <p>And therefore the beginning of the Morning from the time of Mid-night muſt not be aſcribed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the firſt Authors of it (as many unadviſedly do,) nor yet to any other Nation; but it is the moſt ancient Scripture-Computation
<pb facs="tcp:36425:3"/>
from the very firſt created day; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it muſt needs be the true beginning of the Jews Sabbath.</p>
            <p>This Tenent may happily ſeem ſtrange at the firſt, to ſuch as have long held, both in their judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, That the Jews Sabbath (and ſo conſequently the Lords Day) did properly begin at the Sun-ſet evening; and of this judgement and practice are moſt of the Churches in <hi>New England,</hi> and in that reſpect many Profeſſors among them do without ſcruple take liberty in the Sun-ſet Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lords Day, to do the ſervile works of their particular Callings, and others take liberty to uſe Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But it is worthy to be taken notice of, that whole Churches do many times erre, both in their judgement and practice, or elſe how could ſo much Corruption, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, Idolatry, and Prophaneneſſe creep in to ſeveral reformed Churches, as there hath done from time to time in ſundry ages?</p>
            <p>Being therefore intreated by ſome godly perſons in <hi>New England,</hi> and being alſo moved thereunto by the fear of God, I have taken this difficult Task in hand, leſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this corrupt judgement and practice, it ſhould ſpread like Leaven, to the corrupting of Poſterity; and ſo I reſt,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe the firſt Darkneſſe wanted a Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light going before it, which is a proper adjunct, and a true part, of a true created night; and therefore the firſt created night was not without it; and our owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth witneſſe that every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat night hath a Twilight going before it in the evening as a true part thereof as well as a Twilight in the end of it in the morning: But the firſt Darkneſſe, though it had a Twilight in the end of it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the light ſhined out, yet it wanted a Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the beginning of it; therefore it was not a full night: it was no more but a Synecdoche <hi>Membri,</hi> a part of the firſt night.</p>
                  <p>And indeed there could not be a compleat night at firſt, not untill the Artificial day was firſt compleatly formed by the ſhining out of the light twelve houres together, and then at the end of the ſaid twelve houres the light went out of that horizon, and then there ſucceeded another darkneſſe of twelve Houres which began with a Twilight. The firſt halfe of this darkneſſe made up the firſt darkneſſe to be a compleat night
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36425:10"/>
of twelve houres; and the other halfe went on towards the beginning of the ſecond natural day.</p>
                  <p>And thus, after this order and manner the firſt night was created, ſhaped and limited, with a double Twilight, and by this means it became a true pattern and ſampler to all the other Creation nights.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Wilſon</hi> in his <hi>Myſtical Caſes,</hi> in <hi>Aenigmate</hi> 35. propounds this neceſſary Queſtion<hi>:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How can there be Darkneſſe, where there is no Night?</hi>

                  <p>By this Anſwer of his, it is evident that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> did not hold the firſt Darkneſſe to be a true night, as moſt Interpreters doe, though much amiſſe in ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of what I have ſaid, may be drawn up into this Syllogiſm.</p>
                  <p>No Darkneſſe that wants the true ſhape and form of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat night, can be called a compleat night.</p>
                  <p>But the firſt Darkneſſe wanted the true ſhape and form of a compleat night, becauſe it wanted a Twilight in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, which is an inſeparable adjunct to the true ſhape and form of a compleat night.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the firſt Darkneſſe cannot in proper ſpeech be called a compleat night.</p>
                  <p>The Propoſition is ſo clear that I need not prove it, becauſe no man I thinke will deny it.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſumption is thus proved, God made the Stars to rule in the night, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 17. And the Stars were ſet firſt into their dominion in the Twilight Evening of the fourth day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 17. in reſpect whereof <hi>Job</hi> doth call them the Stars of the Twilight, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 9. But the Seventy Tranſlators call them the Stars of the night, becauſe they held <hi>Jobs</hi> Twilight to be a true part of the night; And <hi>Solomon</hi> doth likewiſe make the Twilight of the Evening to be a terme <hi>ſynonimous</hi> with Darkneſſe, and with the night, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9. And <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. ſaith there is the evening of the Sun, and the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Night, when the ſhining of the Sun is gone from off the Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36425:10"/>
For the further proof of this, I refer you to Chapter 4. To my Anſwer to the ſecond Objection.</p>
                  <p>But I will hereunto adde the deſcription of a compleat night, which may further enlighten this truth. <note place="margin">A compleat night is the ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſence of the Suns ſhining for the ſpace of twelve hours.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A compleat night is the abſence of the Suns ſhining from off the face of the earth for the ſpace of twelve houres, when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, as the dayes were in the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This deſcription of the Night agrees with the teſtimony of <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> immediately cited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Why doe you ſet out the ſhape and form of the firſt Artificial day by the ſhining of the Sunne, and of the Night by the abſence of the Suns ſhining? Seeing the Sunne was not created till the fourth day; It is likely that the light that was created the firſt day did not then rule the day after the ſame manner as the Sun did on the fourth day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though there was no Sun-ſhine in the firſt day, yet doubtleſſe inſtead thereof the God of Nature, and the God of Order, did cauſe a certaine light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, from the Element of Fire, in the ſelfe ſame manner and order, as he cauſed the Light to doe on the Fourth Day.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt, the general matter of the Globe, called Earth, was without form, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. becauſe it was voyd of all ornaments for a time; in like ſort the firſt Darkneſſe was at the firſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed thing, and without any ſhape or form of a night, for a time; but after the ſpace of five or ſix houres God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> Gen. 1. 3. It were too groſſe blindneſſe, to think that God did cauſe this Light to breake out of darkneſſe all on a ſudden, like a flaſh of Lightning; no, God was now framing the Firſt Day, to be a Patterne, and Sampler to all the reſt; and therefore the God of Nature, and the God of Order, did cauſe the Light to breake out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by degrees, in the ſame order and manner as he cauſed the Sunne to doe on the Fourth Day, and ſo by this meanes the God of Nature did firſt create a Twilight to the firſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, before he cauſed the light to ſhine out upon the face of the Earth, as he did by the Sunne on the Fourth day; then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he cauſed the Light to aſcend by degrees, until it came to its height at mid-day, and then he cauſed it to decline by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36425:11"/>
until it went off from that Horizon, as the Sunne doth now; and ſo by this meanes the Artificial Day was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaped, and formed, before the whole Night could be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and formed.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, When the Artificial Day was thus formed, by the ſhining of the Light twelve houres, then there ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another Twilight, and twelve houres Darkneſſe more then the firſt Darkneſſe; the firſt halfe of that twelve houres darkneſſe made up the firſt darkneſſe a compleat night of twelve houres, with a double Twilight, and ſo it became a true patterne and ſampler to all other Creation Nights, and then the laſt halfe of the ſaid twelve houres darkneſſe went on towards the beginning of the Second Day.</p>
                  <p>And except this order be obſerved, there cannot be found out a double Twilight to make the firſt Night a compleat pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for all the other Creation nights.</p>

                  <p>It is evident that the firſt Darkneſſe was not a compleat night by the order of that Dominion which God eſtabliſhed for the ruling of the Artificial Day by the Sun, before he gave Dominion to the Moon, and to the Starres, to rule the night.</p>
                  <p>But if the firſt Darkneſſe had been a full night before the Artificial day had received its ſhape and form, then the Moon and Stars ſhould have had their dominion before the Sun, for doubtleſſe the God of order would place them in their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the day of their creation, according to that priority of order which the day had of the night, or the night had of the day. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. 19.</p>
                  <p>If the night of the fourth day had been firſt in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Artificial day, then the Moon and the Stars ſhould have had the priority of their dominion to rule the night of the fourth day, before the Sun could have had its dominion to rule the artificial day; and ſo by this account the Sun ſhall borrow its light from the Moon as the chiefeſt in the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the fourth day: Is not this to make the God of order to be the God of confuſion, in ſetting the Cart before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36425:11"/>
the Horſe, by giving the firſt dominion to the Moon, and the laſt dominion to the Sun; as they do that make the firſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be a compleat night.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe if you think to avoid this Rock, by ſaying that the Sun only was created on the fourth day to rule the artificiall day, and that the Moon and the Stars were not created, and ſet into their rule and dominion till the fifth night, is not this to run againſt the plain Text. For my part I ſhall think him a good Logician (that holds the firſt darkneſſe to be a compleat night) that can fairly get out of this <hi>Dilemma.</hi>

                  <p>If the firſt darkneſſe had been formed into a compleat night before the light was formed into a compleat artificiall day; Then doubtleſſe <hi>Moſes</hi> would have called it Night (as the proper name of its perfect ſhape and form) before he called the light Day: for it was Gods uſuall cuſtome to give names to things in the ſame priority of order, as they had priority of form and ſhape: As for example, As ſoon as he had made man of the earth, he called him <hi>Adam,</hi> and as ſoon as he had made woman of his Rib, he bid <hi>Adam</hi> name her; and as ſoon as he had formed other creatures, he brought them to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; bid him name them with names, defining their natures; &amp; ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs if the firſt <hi>darknes,</hi> had been firſt form'd into a compleat <hi>night,</hi> he would have named it night in the firſt place; but he called it nothing elſe but Darkneſſe at firſt, ſaying the darkneſſe was, namely it was a miſ-ſhapen and uncreated thing: But as ſoon as he had put a ſhape, and limited it by a double Twilight, he called it night, as the name of its perfect form and ſhape: But it could not receive this ſhape and form untill the light was firſt ſhaped and formed into an artificial day by its orderly ſhining upon the face of the earth for twelve hours together, and then he called it day, as the proper name of its perfect ſhape and form.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may cleerly perceive, That <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. doth name all the parts of the firſt natural day in their true pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of order as they were ſhaped and formed, 1 Day, 2 Night, 3 Evening, 4 Morning. And ſecondly, hence it follows that

the firſt formed part of the naturall day, was the artificiall day, and not the night.</p>

                  <p>If <hi>Moſes</hi> had intended to call the firſt darkneſſe Evening as <hi>ſynonimous</hi> to the terme Night, then doubtleſſe ſome Scripture or other would have ſhewed them to be <hi>ſynonima,</hi> ſeeing the ſaid termes are ſo often repeated in the Bible.</p>
                  <p>But though I have made diligent ſearch, yet I cannot finde where the term Morning is made <hi>ſynonimous</hi> to the ful artificial

                  <p>Object. <hi>Why might not the firſt Darkneſſe be a full Evening, and ſo a full night of twelve houres, though it wanted a Twilight in the beginning of it? might not God diſpenſe with the Twilight in the firſt night?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Why do you go about to make the moſt wiſe Creator and Governour of all things, to be an imperfect Artiſt in his firſt pattern? for if you make the firſt Night to want a Twilight in the beginning of it, do you not thereby make him an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Artiſt in his firſt pattern to the other creation dayes? for it is manifeſt, that the ſhape and form of the firſt creation day was a true pattern by which the reſt were ſhaped and formed; for as the text expreſſeth it in verſe 5. ſo was the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo was the Evening the firſt day; ſo in like ſort it is ſaid of the ſecond day in verſe 8. and ſo it is ſaid of the third day in verſe 13. and ſo it is ſaid of the fourth day in verſe 19. and ſo it is ſaid of the fifth and ſixth days, all theſe dayes were ſhaped and formed juſt according to the pattern of the firſt day.</p>
                  <p>The addition of the Sun in the fourth day made no new part of Light more then the firſt day had, as I have noted it already, and therefore the manner how the Light did break out of Darkneſſe on the firſt day, was in the ſame manner and order as we ſee the Sun doth in the Equinoctial.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Light aſcended out of darkneſſe by degrees, as the Sun doth now, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. By means whereof it did firſt make a Twilight in the morning, ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe calleth it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 147.</p>

In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they make no other part of the artificial Day to be called Morning; but a little point of time in the beginning of the artificial day onely, and this Expoſition they borrow from</hi> Tremelius <hi>Annotation on</hi> Gen. 1. 5. <hi>or rather from</hi> Junius, <hi>for it is eaſie to make it appear, that</hi> Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius <hi>was of another judgement.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> A man had need of more patience then ordinary that ſhall ſpend his time to anſwer ſuch fantaſtical conceits as this. But in brief, I think I have fully confounded this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 By proving that <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. divided the firſt natural day into two equall parts two ſeveral wayes, as I have exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified it by the lines of longitude and latitude on a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe Diall in <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. and ſee alſo the gradations to the morning in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. at Sixthly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 I anſwer by proving that <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the latter halfe of the artificial day to the firſt halfe of the Night, and ſo making it to be an equall part of time to <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning. But the beſt way to anſwer this, and many
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36425:13"/>
other Objections, is to lay downe the true interpretation of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, in the various uſe of it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that <hi>Gnereb</hi> is uſually interpreted to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <note place="margin">The Hebrew word Gnereb, which is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Evening, in Gen. 1. 5. explained.</note> a mixing, or mingling of things together; but I diſlike this interpretation, becauſe it is not poſſible by this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find out the true form, &amp; ſhape of the Natural Evening, I have therefore made diligent ſearch into the various uſe of this word, and I finde that <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth ſignifie (not a confuſed mixing and mingling of things together, but) a connexing, conjoyning, or coupling of two or more diſtinct things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without confounding their ſeverall ſpecies, or natures, and therefore Wine and Water mixed together cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gnereb,</hi> neither can the confuſed mingling of Light and Darkneſſe together (as it is in the Twilight) be called <hi>Gne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb,</hi> and yet that ſhort time of Twilight is comprehended within the large limits of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> becauſe it is the partition of <hi>(Gnarbaiim)</hi> the two Evenings; but the Twilight it ſelfe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expreſſed by two other ſeverall Hebrew words, and never by <hi>Gnereb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thing I ayme at in this Diſcourſe is only to clear the true ſignification of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> from a confuſed mixing or ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of things together, and to make it clear and evident, that it only ſignifies a conjunction of two or more diſtinct things together, and therefore that <hi>Gnereb</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. muſt ſignifie the conjunction of the laſt halfe of the Artificiall day to the firſt halfe of the Night, and that theſe two diſtinct parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed are an even and equal portion of time to <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning.</p>
                  <p>2. I wil explaine the true meaning of this phraſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. ſo was the Evening, and ſo was the Morning. Firſt mark the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; in the former part of the Verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>God called the light Day, and the darkneſſe he called Night;</hi> and then it follows, ſo was the Evening; but how was that? was it framed out of the darkneſſe only? No, it was framed and formed both out of the ſaid Light called Day, and out of the ſaid Darkneſſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Night, <hi>Conjunctim,</hi> and not <hi>Diviſim,</hi> namely, the Evening was framed by conjoyning the latter halfe of the Artificiall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36425:14"/>
day to the firſt halfe of the Night; and ſo was the Morning, namely, it was in like ſort framed out of the Darkneſſe called Night, and out of the Light called Day, by conjoyning the laſt halfe of the Night to the firſt halfe of the Artificiall day: and it is moſt evident that this was the true meaning of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> becauſe he doth afterwards explaine <hi>Gnereb</hi> the ſingle Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings eleaven times over, and the reaſon is, becauſe the ful Natural evening hath two parts; namely the firſt halfe is Day, and the latter halfe is Night, as I ſhal open the matter more at large, both in this Chapter by and by, and in Chapter the fift.</p>
                  <p>And from this interpretation of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. theſe three Concluſions do follow.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 That the Firſt Darkneſſe is not, nor cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening.</item>
                     <item>2 That the whole Night is not, nor cannot be called <hi>Gne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb</hi> the Evening, in a proper ſenſe.</item>
                     <item>3 That the Twilight cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe none of theſe three have any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conjunction of ſpecies to make them <hi>Gnereb;</hi> and from this interpretation of <hi>Gnereb</hi> I frame this Argument.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Darkneſſe by it ſelfe conſidered cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, neither can the confuſed mixture of the Twilight be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, becauſe <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth ſignifie (not ſuch a mixture as is confuſed, but) a connexing, or conjoyning of two or more things together, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their diſtinct ſpecies; and there are no other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſpecies in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. to be conjoyned together, but the Light called Day, and the Darkneſſe called Night.</p>
                  <p>But the firſt darkneſſe was pure darkneſſe, and no other thing was connexed to it til the Light was created, and that connexion though at the firſt it might have been called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> yet now it muſt not be called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> becauſe it pleaſed God to call it <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the firſt Darkneſſe by it ſelfe conſidered, cannot be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, neither was it framed into any part of the Evening at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:36425:14"/>
The Aſſumption wil not be denied.</p>
                  <p>The Propoſition I prove ſeverall wayes.</p>
                  <p>But firſt I wil begin it by a particular examination of the various uſe of the Hebrew word <hi>Gnereb</hi> thorow out the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Gnereb</hi> is put for the conjunction of two perſons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a contract of Marriage, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 35. it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo put for the connexion of Iron and Clay in the feet of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzars</hi> Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 41. 43. which connexion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be the joyning together of the Seleucida and the Lagida by Marriages, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 16, 17. in like ſort that Phraſe of going in to another by way of Marriage, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 1, 2. is called <hi>Gnereb</hi> in the <hi>Chalde,</hi> and the going in to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23. 7. is called <hi>Gnereb</hi> in the <hi>Chalde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe inſtances doe prove that <hi>Gnereb</hi> is a connexion of two diſtinct Perſons or Species together, without confounding the Species.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Gnereb</hi> is put for Merchandiſe, becauſe of the connexion of ſundry ſorts of Wares the Merchants uſe to joyne together, when they carry them to Faires or Markets to ſell, <hi>Eze.</hi> 27. 17. 19. 25. 27, 31. 34. <hi>Gnereb</hi> is alſo put for Merchants by the Figure <hi>Metonymia,</hi> either becauſe of the ſaid connexion of ſundry ſorts of Wares, or elſe becauſe of their manifold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts with other perſons, which contracts are uſually made by connexing their hands together, <hi>Eze.</hi> 27. 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Gnereb</hi> is put for things that are ſweet, or pleaſant, by the Figure <hi>Synecdoche;</hi> it is put for a ſweet or pleaſant voyce, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. and for ſweet ſleep, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 26. and for other ſweet and pleaſant things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 34 <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9. 4, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 4. but none of theſe things can be ſaid to be ſweet or pleaſant until they be connexed to ſome of the five Senſes, or to ſome of the affections of the Soule; as for example, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 34. my meditation of him ſhal bee ſweet, or my meditation ſhal be connexed to him, namely, with delightful thoughts.</p>

This explanation of <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth lead us by the hand to the right underſtanding of <hi>Gnereb</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. namely, that it ſignifies the connexion of the latter halfe of the Artificiall day with the firſt halfe of the Night; this part of the Naturall day our Anceſtors did moſt fitly call the Evening; Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Our Anceſtors held Gnereb the Evening to be at all times of the yeare an even and equal part of time to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> it was the even or equal part to <hi>Boker</hi> the morning. And Secondly, our Anceſtors held the Evening to be a diſtinct and differing portion of time from the time called Night; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed experience doth tell us, that the Night is not alwayes an Even part of time to the Artificiall day, that it is many times longer, and many times ſhorter than the day; but the Evening as it is taken from mid-day to midnight, is alwayes an even or equal part of time to <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning, Summer and Winter, all the world over, and therefore our Anceſtors could not ſo fitly have called the whole night an Evening, in relation to the Artificiall day, as moſt would have them ſpeak, though upon better advice they wil now think otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 3. <hi>What need is there to make</hi> Gnereb <hi>comprehend ſuch a large portion of time, as is the connexion of the latter halfe of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall day, to the firſt halfe of the Night; will not that little peece of light which remains after Sun-ſet, and which is connexed to the Night, ſufficiently ſerve to make up the true compoſition of</hi> Gnereb <hi>the Evening?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our diſpute did ariſe at firſt about the firſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whether <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. did call it <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or no? I told you no, becauſe it was pure darkneſſe without any connexion of light at the beginning of it, and <note place="margin">Gnereb the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening is often put by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche for that halfe of the Evening, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the latter Evening, which doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes begin at Sun-ſet.</note> when God created the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſſe, God called that Light (when it had run the courſe of twelve hours) Day, and the firſt halfe of it, with the firſt darkneſſe, he did at laſt call it <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning (namely after the whole time of the Naturall day had run its courſe, and after the Darkneſſe was formed into a Night.) Hence it followes, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Gnereb</hi> was formed firſt from the latter halfe of the Artificiall day, and from the firſt halfe of the Night; but that little peece of light that remaines after Sun-ſet is no part of the Artificiall day (which is due to <hi>Gnereb)</hi> but it is a true part of the Night, and it is preſently confounded with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and it is therefore called Twilight, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fitly be called <hi>Gnereb.</hi>

And truly, ſeeing the South-weſt Wind proceeds indifferently both from the South, and from the Weſt conjoyned, it doth moſt fitly anſwer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or connexion of <hi>Gnereb;</hi> but it is evident that <hi>Gnereb</hi> is often put for the Weſt by the Figure Metonymia, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 28. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 15. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 16. 18. 30. and often elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and in this reſpect the Twilight is contained within that portion of time which is called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> but yet the Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light by it ſelfe is never called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> but two other Hebrew words are uſed to expreſs the time of Twilight, as I noted afore.</p>

In the Evening time it ſhall be light; the alluſion is moſt fit and proper to the firſt Evening, which doth alwaies begin at Mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun, and then the Sun is in its greateſt ſtrength both for light and heat; and then Chriſt Jeſus appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> for his converſion, that he might ſend him among the Gentiles that ſate in darkneſſe, <hi>to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God, Act.</hi> 22. 6, 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 13, 18. and he made the word of God to abound through a great part of the world, even from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illiricum, Rom.</hi> 15. 19. In this evening time of the world, the Goſpel did ſhine in its ful ſtrength, for now Chriſt and his twelve Apoſtles, and ſeventy Diſciples, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets and Teachers, did confirme their doctrine with ſigns and wonders, to the converſion of many ten thouſand ſoules that formerly ſate in darkneſſe under the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
                  <p>6 <hi>Gnereb</hi> is put for the laſt end of a thing, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 11.

In like ſort they did ſometimes call the whole week the Sabbath, and the ſeven weekes to Penticoſt they called ſeven Sabbaths, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 15. and the Phariſee ſaid, <hi>I faſt twice in the Sabbath, Luk.</hi> 18. 12. or, twice <hi>in the week;</hi> now if the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had been the beginning of the Natural day, then all theſe alluſions from <hi>Gnereb</hi> to the laſt times, or to the laſt end of a thing, had been very improper and very abſurd.</p>
                  <p>7 <hi>Gnereb,</hi> by the figure Synecdoche, is often put for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular hour in the afternoon, or in the beginning of the night, for the Jews were to tranſact many Civil and many Religious actions in the ſeverall houres of <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, and in that reſpect any of thoſe houres may be called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: But at firſt when <hi>Moſes</hi> did conjoyn and ſet together all the parts and parcels of the firſt natural day, No queſtion but he did uſe <hi>Gnereb</hi> in its full and proper ſenſe for the conjunction

                  <p>Theſe two Evenings were famouſly known to all the Jewes in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for when <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded them to kill the Paſſeover between the two Evenings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6. he did not explain what he meant by the two Evenings, he did not make any circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall deſcription of them, which had been neceſſary if they had not been familiarly acquainted with the ſeveral limits of them; but he doth onely barely name them as a thing that was familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to them.</p>
                  <p>Five times over the Lord commanded them to ſacrifiſe all their Paſſeovers between the two Evenings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 3, 5, 11. and four times over the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to ſacrifiſe the daily Evening ſacrifice between the two Evenings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 39, 41. <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 4, 8.</p>

                  <p>His meaning is according to other Hebrew Doctors, namely, that the Evening of the Suns declining, begins at the firſt declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sun at Mid-day, and that the Evening of the Suns ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting doth begin then.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> in his Hebrew Lexicon upon the word <hi>Gnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baiim</hi> doth cite other Hebrew Canons to this very purpoſe; But I ſhall refer you to Chap. 5. for a further deſcription of the two Evenings, where I explaine the Paſſeover Evening.</p>
                  <p>I have already cited nine places of Scripture, where the term of two Evenings is cited in the Hebrew text, and now I will cite two places more: The Prieſts were commanded to light up their Lamps between the two Evenings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 8. and the Quailes came between the two Evenings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 12. Alſo I find one clear example of the two Evenings in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in one and the ſame day; It is ſaid in <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>When it was evening the Diſciples came to him and ſaid, the time is now paſt</hi> (that is to ſay, it is now paſt dinner time) <hi>ſend the multitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> But Chriſt did not ſend them away untill he had firſt made them dine, and after they had well dined, then he ſent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<hi>:</hi> After this Evening Chriſt went up into a mountain to pray, and then it is ſaid againe, <hi>When the Evening was come, hee was there alone,</hi> ver. 23. This Evening in ver. 23. is another Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning beſides that in verſ. 15. and between theſe two Evenings Chriſt did a long action, for he fed many thouſands plentifully; And thus I have proved by a Jury of twelve Witneſſes that the naturall Evening is divided into two Evenings, and I have ſet out the limits of the firſt Evening by the teſtimony of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors from Mid-day till Sun-ſet, and the latter Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begins at Sun-ſet, and ends at mid-night, and both theſe Evenings are called <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> in the duall number; that is ſay, the Twy-party Evening; for ſo <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> in the duall number muſt be underſtood, as it appears by the like form of ſpeech, where the Scripture ſetteth out the twy-party connexture of other things, as for example, <hi>Ramath</hi> in mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 19.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36425:19"/>
is called <hi>Ramothaim</hi> in the dual number, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 1. ſome Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators render it the two <hi>Ramaths</hi> in mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but indeed they are deceived, for there is but one <hi>Ramath</hi> in Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and that <hi>Ramath</hi> is called <hi>Ramothaim</hi> in the dual number, becauſe it had two parts, and ſo <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is uſually called <hi>Jeruſalaim</hi> in the duall number, 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 5. 6, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 18. not becauſe there were two <hi>Jeruſalems,</hi> but becauſe the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had two principal parts; for firſt, There was the City of the people on the one part; and ſecondly, There was the City of <hi>David</hi> and mount <hi>Zion</hi> on the other part; but neither of theſe parts alone could properly be called the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but both parts muſt be put together to make up the full City <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and in this reſpect it might well be called the double <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the twy-party <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the like may be ſaid of <hi>Ramothaim,</hi> for there was but one City in Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> that was called <hi>Ramath,</hi> as verſ. 19. tels us, But this City was called <hi>Ramothaim</hi> in the duall number, becauſe it had two principall parts. Firſt, There was the City of the people on the one part; And ſecondly, There was <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramath</hi> on the other part where the High place was, and where <hi>Samuel</hi> dwelt, and kept a Prophets School, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 18, 19. But neither of theſe parts could properly be called the full City <hi>Ramath,</hi> but both of them together did make up the full City <hi>Ramath.</hi> So alſo <hi>Diblath, Ezek.</hi> 6. 14. is <hi>Diblathaim, Jerm.</hi> 48. 22. And ſo <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening is ſometimes called <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings, but neither of thoſe two Evenings taken a part can properly be called <hi>Gnereb</hi> the full naturall Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it is meant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. but both of them put together do make up the full natural Evening; and in this reſpect <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> may be tranſlated the twofold evening or the twy-party evening, as well as the two Evenings, becauſe indeed there is but one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Evening, which is divided by the time of Sunſet into two principall parts. It is therefore but a woodden ſhift of ſome Scholars to call the firſt Evening an improper Evening, and to call the latter Evening onely the full naturall Evening: The like woodden ſhift it is to make no other part of time to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gnereb</hi> properly, but the very beginning of the Night, or of the later Evening onely, as ſome do interpret <hi>Junius</hi> Annotation on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Holy Spirit had framed <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> to ſet out both a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36425:20"/>
proper and an improper Evening with one and the ſame voice and breath, then doubtleſſe the ſeventy Tranſlators being He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <note place="margin">The ſeventy Interpreters do make the two Evenings to be but one proper Evening.</note> Doctors would have found it out, and then they would have deſcribed the various acceptation of the word, by ſome marke of diſtinction or other, eſpecially conſidering they took liberty to vary the terme of their tranſlation from <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> for they do never fully expreſſe the term <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings in any place, but nine times over they tranſlate it by the ſingle term Evening, and therefore if they had accounted the firſt part of it to have been an improper Evening, and the latter part onely proper, then doubtleſſe they would ſomewhere or other have given ſome mark of diſtinction whereby to know them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, eſpecially ſeeing they take liberty to alter the phraſe; But it ſeems to me they accounted both the parts of <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> to be but one proper naturall Evening, becauſe they do nine times over tranſlate <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> by the ſingle term Evening. I confeſſe they doe once after a ſort ſet out the two parts of <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5. for there the Seventy read the Text thus. In the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the month, between the middle of thoſe things that belong to the Evening; in this tranſlation they doe not fully name the two Evenings, but yet after a ſort they doe name the two Evenings, becauſe they ſay between the middle of thoſe things that belong to the Evening; their meaning muſt be this, In the beginning of the Paſſeover Evening, they in the firſt place did offer the daily evening Sacrifice, burne Incenſe, trim the Lamps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, As ſoon as the latter evening was come (which did, alwaies begin at Sun-ſet) they began to feaſt upon the fleſh of their Paſſeovers, and of their Peace-offerings, in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn religious manner<hi>:</hi> Now between, or in the middle of theſe things all their Paſſeovers were ſacrificed. And thus by this Interpretation it appears evidently that the ſeventy Tranſlators held <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> to be but one proper naturall evening divided into two princiall parts, becauſe they called that which was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two evenings, the middle of the evening in the ſingular number. Therefore I may well conclude, that their diſtinction is abſurd, that make the firſt part of <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> to be no more but an improper evening, and that make the latter part onely proper. I think no man that is well adviſed can find any harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Scripture by this Interpretation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:36425:20"/>
3. It is alſo evident that <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, is as large in length of time as <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> the two Evenings is; for not onely <note place="margin">The Hebrew text doth make the two Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be but one proper Evening.</note> the Seventy do tranſlate <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> by the ſingle term Evening; but the Hebrew Text it ſelfe doth often put <hi>Gnereb</hi> for <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> interchangeably, as for example, four places of Scripture doe command them to offer the daily evening Sacrifice between the two evenings, but many more places ſay it ſhould be done or ſacrificed in <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening; five places command all the Paſſeovers to be ſacrificed between the two evenings, but more places ſay it ſhall be done or ſacrificed in <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening; one place ſaith, that the Prieſts muſt cauſe the Lamps to burne between the two evenings, but other places ſay in the evening; one place ſaith the Quailes came between the two evenings, but other places ſay they came in <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening: Therefore <hi>Gnereb</hi> and <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> is but one proper evening; <hi>Gnereb</hi> is as large in time as <hi>Gnarbaiim</hi> is, both parts together make up the true and proper naturall evening called <hi>Gnereb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I conclude, that the Hebrew word <hi>Gnereb</hi> doth not <note place="margin">The two parts of Gnereb ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified.</note> ſignifie ſuch a confuſed mixture as is between light and darkneſſe in the Twilight; but it ſignifies ſuch a diſtinct connexion of Day and Night together, as may be called <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> the two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venings, and ſuch a connexion as may be diſtinguiſhed or ſevered from each other into two diſtinct parts: as I may exemplifie the matter by a party-coloured coat, one half is white and the other halfe is black; ſo is <hi>Gnereb</hi> the evening, the firſt halfe is white called day, and the other halfe is black called night, and the time of Twilight that couples theſe two evenings together, may be likened to the ſeam that couples the white and black peeces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the compleating of the party-coloured coat. Or thus, the two parts of <hi>Gnereb</hi> may be exemplified by the cloud that ſtood between the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> the one halfe of the cloud was light towards the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the other halfe was dark towards the <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> 14. 20. So is <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the natural evening, the firſt halfe is light called day, and the other half is dark called night.</p>
                  <p>But if the naturall evening had been nothing elſe but night, as moſt Interpreters doe affirme upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. then all evening Sacrifices muſt have been offered in the night time only; but the Hebrew Doctors wil laugh that opinion to ſcorn as a foule ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36425:21"/>
for after Sun-ſet (ſay they) the blood of all Sacrifices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unlawful, ſee <hi>Ainſ. in Lev.</hi> 6. 9.

                  </head>
                  <p>THe firſt Scripture by which I prove that the Natural Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth begin at Mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun, is from <hi>Jeremy,</hi> whoſe ſpeech is both plain and elegant, <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks thus in the perſon of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Souldiers, <hi>Ariſe, let us go up at noon; woe unto us, for the day declineth, and the ſhadowes of the evening are ſtretched out, Jer.</hi> 6. 4. Theſe words are ſpoken by way of alluſion; but yet two phraſes are remarkable in this Text. 1. The day declineth. 2. The ſhadowes of the evening are ſtretched out; both theſe termes are Synonima, and mean the ſame time of the day; for as ſoon as the day begins to decline, the ſhadowes of the evening begin to be ſtretched out. Hence then it follows, 1. That the evening doth begin as ſoon as the day begins to decline. 2. That the ſhadowes of the evening do begin to ſtretch themſelves as ſoon as the ſun which rules the day, doth begin firſt to decline.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks theſe words in the perſon of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who made haſte to deſtroy the Jewes by the Noon-tide, but when they were upon their march they ſaw they were like to come ſhort of the appointed time, and therefore they cry out in an angry paſſion, <hi>Woe unto us, for the day declineth, and the ſhadowes of the evening are ſtretched out.</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36425:21"/>
by way of Proſopopeia; yet there muſt be a reall truth in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I prove that the natural Evening begins at Mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun, by <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>When the Evening was come; Luke</hi> expounds this evening to be come, when the day began to go down or decline, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 12. So Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> renders the Text: And when elſe doth the day firſt begin to go down or decline, but when the Sun that rules the Day doth firſt begin to go down or decline? as is above obſerved from <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 4. And experience doth tell us, that the Sun doth firſt begin to decline at mid-day, and that it continues declining till Sun-ſet; So then, from the term Evening in <hi>Matthew</hi> deſcribed by this adjunct in <hi>Luke,</hi> when the day begins to go down or decline, it may truly be gathered by neceſſary conſequence, that the natural evening doth begin at mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun; and this evening hath two parts, the firſt part begins at the firſt declining of the Sun, as I have already expounded, v. 15. and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evening doth begin at Sun-ſet, in v. 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I prove that the full natural evening begins at mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun, by <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the Paſſeover at Evening, at the going down of the Sun, at the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thou cameſt out of</hi> Egypt. This Text is very pregnant to prove the point in queſtion; but becauſe I have occaſion to expound this Text at large in chap. 5. Therefore I refer the Reader thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I prove that the full natural Evening begins at mid-day by 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>David</hi> doth there intreat <hi>Jonathan</hi> to meet him on the third day at Even, and it appears that <hi>Jonathan</hi> was very careful to obſerve the punctual beginning of this appointed evening, becauſe it was a matter of weight, and becauſe <hi>David</hi> depended upon his punctual obſervation of the preciſe time, therefore <hi>Jonathan</hi> did confirm his promiſe by an oath, ver. 13. beſides, <hi>David</hi> did over and above all this charge <hi>Jonathan</hi> to come to him quickly or diligently, that is to ſay, to be exact, and to keep the appointed time diligently or punctually, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jonathan</hi> did manifeſt his diligence to obſerve the punctual time, as it is evident, becauſe he went out into the field on the third day in the Morning, which (ſaith the Text) was <hi>at the time appointed with David,</hi> v. 35.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:36425:22"/>Object, 4. <hi>How can you make</hi> Jonathans <hi>Morning to be the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time with</hi> David, <hi>ſeeing</hi> David <hi>did not appoint</hi> Jonathan <hi>to meet him on the third day in the morning, but on the third day at even, as</hi> v. 5. <hi>teſtifieth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Jonathans</hi> morning was the appointed time with <hi>David,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jonathans</hi> morning did end at mid-day, and <hi>Davids</hi> evening did begin at mid-day, at the firſt declining of the Sun: now <hi>Jonathan</hi> could not have come quickly, diligently, exactly and punctually to the place appointed at the beginning of the evening, unleſſe he went out on the third day morning, that is to ſay, a little before the evening began; but by his diligence in taking in a little peece of the morning at the beginning of his Journey, he might well be at the place appointed according to the punctuall time of the appointed Evening; and thus <hi>Jonathans</hi> Morning and <hi>Davids</hi> Evening do meet together at Mid-day, and no other reſolution can be given, as I conceive, to make <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> morning and <hi>Davids</hi> evening to agree together at one and the ſame appointed time but this.</p>
                  <p>Object. 5. <hi>Why may not the appointed evening be underſtood of the night-evening, and the appointed place be a great way off, and in that reſpect</hi> Jonathan <hi>might begin his journey in the morning, that ſo he might come to the place appointed at the time of the Sun-ſet evening?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I perceive that men are loath to have any other evening, but the night-evening, and therefore they are willing to raiſe what Objections they can againſt the mid-day evening: But I will give you divers Reaſons why the appointed evening cannot be meant of the Sun-ſet evening.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If the place of meeting had been ſo far off as to cauſe <hi>Jonathan</hi> to ſpend ſo much time in going thither as from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till Sun-ſet, then <hi>Jonathan</hi> could not have had time enough left to return back again into the City in the ſame day. But the Text in ver. 23. doth tell us that <hi>Jonathan</hi> did return the ſame day into the City; therefore the appointed evening cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the ſun-ſet evening.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Jonathan</hi> returned alone without any company with him, for he had ſent his Boy back into the City before, which in reaſon he would not have done, if the place of meeting had been ſo far off as you make it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:36425:22"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Jonathan</hi> knew that <hi>Saul</hi> was jealous of his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with <hi>David,</hi> and he knew alſo that <hi>Saul</hi> was much inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt <hi>David</hi> at this time; Therefore in wiſdom <hi>Jonathan</hi> would not be ſo long abſent from <hi>Saul</hi> as from morning till Sun-ſet; nay, it would have been Mid-night ere he could have returned, if the place appointed to meet at had been ſo far off as you would make it, and then <hi>Soul</hi> might well have ſuſpected that <hi>Jonathan</hi> might have had ſome other errand into the field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſhooting at a mark, by his long and late abſence; but <hi>Ionathan</hi> pretended no other errand but to ſhoot at a mark, and therefore he took his Boy with him to witneſſe ſo much if need ſhould be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence it followes, that the place of meeting was but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way without the City; for what need had a man goe farre to ſhoot at a Mark? and ſo it asked but a little time to goe to it, and to return from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hence it followes, that the appointed Evening muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Mid-day Evening, and not of the Sun-ſet Evening: And thus <hi>Jonathans</hi> Morning and <hi>Davids</hi> Evening did fitly agree to the ſame appointed hour at Mid-day.</p>
                  <p>In like ſort one Evangeliſt ſaith that Chriſt was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the third houre, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. 25. But <hi>John</hi> ſaith he was crucified at the ſixt hour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 14. this differing relation of time, may ſeem to have as great a difference as is between <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans</hi> Morning and <hi>Davids</hi> Evening, and yet there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all when things come to be rightly expounded: For the Jewes divided the Artificiall Day into four great Hours, juſt as they divided the Night into four great Watches, <hi>Mark.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Jews di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the day into four great hours, as they divided the night into four watches.</note> 13. 35. every great hour contained in it three ſmall houres; The firſt great hour they called by the name of the third hour, becauſe it ended with the third ſmall hour, which we call nine a clock; and their ſecond great hour they called their ſixt, becauſe it ended with the ſixt ſmall hour, which we call twelve a clock; and thus as ſoon as the firſt great hour ended with our nine a clock, the ſecond great hour began with our ten a clock: And thus <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in the <hi>Judges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Godwin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weames,</hi> do accord theſe great hours with our ſmall hours, and juſt after this ſort the end of <hi>Jonathans</hi> Morning in v. 35. and the beginnings of <hi>Davids</hi> Evening in v. 5. do fitly cloſe and meet together at Mid-day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:36425:23"/>
Fifthly, I prove that the naturall Evening doth begin at Mid-day, by <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 6. There <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Elders fell down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth before the Ark of the Lord till Even-tide, that is to ſay until Evening began.</p>
                  <p>Object. 6. <hi>This Even-tide muſt be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer no, it cannot be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Evening, for <hi>Joſhua</hi> had much buſineſſe to doe after this, which muſt be done before the time of Sunſet, for the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to ſanctifie the people againſt the morrow, Verſ. 13, 14. But <hi>Joſhua</hi> could not ſanctifie them at the Sun-ſet Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for then the day of their cleanneſſe muſt begin, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law; they muſt therefore be waſhed from their defilements in the afternoon, or elſe they could not begin the day of their cleanneſſe at their Sun-ſet Evening; and in caſe they did not begin the new day of their cleanneſſe at Sun-ſet, they might not come before the Lords Arke on the morrow to beg Attonement for Tranſgreſſors, as I have opened the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more at large in Chap. 4.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Joſhua</hi> could not have ſanctified the people in a fit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to come before the Lords Ark on the morrow, if he had lain ſtill upon the earth till the Even-tide at Sun-ſet; for <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt have a large time to inform all the people by a Proclamation through all the Camp, what was the cauſe of the Lords anger, and what they muſt do by way of preparation before they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Lords favour<hi>:</hi> The thing they muſt do by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was to ſanctifie themſelves from their Ceremonial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, by waſhing their Bodies and their Cloaths according to the Ceremonial cuſtoms, as they are ſet down in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2. and this muſt be done in the ſame Even-tide wherein the Lord ſpake to <hi>Joſhua</hi> and to the Elders, ſaying, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p, and ſanctifie the people, and ſay, ſanctifie your ſelves againſt to morrow,</hi> Verſ. 13. Now then conſider the time that muſt be taken up for this Proclamation throughout all the Camp, and conſider the time they muſt have for the waſhing of all their Bodies and their Cloaths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sun-ſet, and then it will neceſſarily force us to underſtand this Even-tide of the Noon-tide Evening, and not of the Sun-ſet Evening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:36425:23"/>
Sixthly, I prove, That the full naturall Evening begins at Mid-day when the Afternoon begins, becauſe the Evening in Scripture is often put for the Afternoon, as the morning is put for the Forenoon: <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the Evening let not thy hand reſt, Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Solomons</hi> meaning is, that men ſhould be as diligent in doing good at all times, as the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is in ſeed-time; he will not reſt from ſowing his ſeed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forenoon nor afternoon, becauſe he knows not which will prove beſt. A wiſe and diligent Husband-man will go out to ſow his ſeed in the afternoon Evening, and not defer it till the Sun-ſet Evening; therefore by <hi>Solomons</hi> account the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the Afternoon at Mid-day.</p>
                  <p>2. It is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 6. <hi>In the morning the graſſe flouriſheth and groweth up, but in the evening it is cut down and withereth:</hi> The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman doth not uſe to go out to mow his graſſe in the evening after Sun-ſet, or if he ſometimes do ſo, yet it doth not wither in the evening after Sun-ſet; But Husbandmen uſe to take the opportunity to mow their graſſe in the afternoon, and then it withereth, therefore the Evening begins with the afternoon.</p>
                  <p>3. It is ſaid in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 16. that <hi>Goliah</hi> drew near Morning and Evening forty days together<hi>:</hi> But Souldiers doe not uſe to call for a Pitched Battle in the evening after Sun-ſet, but either in the Forenoon or in the Afternoon Evening.</p>
                  <p>4. It is ſaid 1 <hi>King</hi> 17. 6. That the Ravens brought bread and fleſh to <hi>Elijah</hi> morning and evening: but the Ravens do not uſe to carry meat in the evening after Sun-ſet, for then they uſe to flie to their Rooſt, and ſo to continue there all night; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ravens carried meat to <hi>Elijah</hi> in the Afternoon Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Paul</hi> ſent for the Jews in <hi>Rome</hi> to come to his Iodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he might teſtifie unto them the things of the Kingdome of God, and that he might perſwade them concerning Jeſus, and they came at the day appointed, and then <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto them from morning till evening, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 23. But I think no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate man will ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> continued his Sermon to that mixed multitude from the morning light, till the evening at Sun-ſet: The hungry bellies and captious ſpirits of moſt of theſe Jewes would not indure it; neither would <hi>Pauls</hi> wiſdom nor
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36425:24"/>
his ſtrength ſuffer him to offer it, eſpecially ſeeing the Jewes of this Synagogue had before-hand manifeſted to <hi>Paul</hi> their diſlike of this Sect, verſ. 22.</p>
                  <p>Theſe circumſtances conſidered, this phraſe from morning till evening muſt be underſtood of a convenient portion of time for one Sermon. It is like they came to <hi>Pauls</hi> lodging at the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary houre wherein they uſed to reſort to their Synagogues, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine a clock in the morning, and it is like alſo that <hi>Paul</hi> continued his Sermon to them till the Noon-tide evening, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more or leſſe, as in wiſdom he thought it convenient, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered, and in likelihood the Jews would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point to meet at <hi>Pauls</hi> lodging before the ordinary hour of morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer, nor be contented to ſtay longer than Dinner-time, when the Evening begins, at Mid-day; therefore it may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by probable conjecture, that the evening began at Mid-day in <hi>Rome</hi> as well as in <hi>Iudea.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe firſt Natural day in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5, was twice divided by <hi>Moſes,</hi> juſt according to the Lines of Longitude and Latitude in the Globe, and it was ſhaped and framed together in this order.</p>
                  <p>Take a peece of paper and pourtray upon it the ſhape or image of a compaſſe Dial. Then firſt ſhadow out upon it the firſt darkneſs from the North point almoſt to the Eaſt point.</p>
                  <p>2. Then ſhadow out a little peece of Twilight to fill it up to the Eaſt point, as a ſign that the light did thence break out of darkneſſe by degrees.</p>
                  <p>3. Then ſhadow out a peece of light of ſix hours long, for the aſcending of the ſhining light from the Eaſt point to the South point.</p>
                  <p>4. Then make a mark of diſtinction at the South point for the ſtanding ſtill of the light for a little while at Mid-day.</p>
                  <p>5. Then ſhadow out another peece of light of ſix hours long for the declining of the light from the South point to the Weſt point.</p>
                  <p>6 Then write upon all this ſhining light from the Eaſt point to the Weſt point, the name Day, as the proper name of his perfect ſhape and limit; and in this order was the firſt Artificiall Day ſhaped out, limited, and named.</p>
                  <p>7. Then ſhadow out a little peece of Twilight, at the departure of the light out of that Horizon, on the inſide of the Weſt point.</p>
                  <p>8. Then take twelve hours darkneſſe, and ſhadow out the firſt half of that Darkneſſe from the Weſt point untill it meet with the place of the firſt darkneſſe at the North point.</p>
                  <p>9. Then write upon all that Darkneſſe from the Weſt point to the Eaſt point, the name Night, as the proper name of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhape and limit, and in this order was the night laſt ſhaped out, limited and named. Then let the other half of the laſt twelve hours Darkneſſe be ſet upon the out-ſide of the ſame Compaſſe Diall, from the North point to the Eaſt point, for the beginning of the ſecond Day.</p>

10. Hence we may obſerve the Reaſon why the firſt Darknes could not be called Night at firſt, namely, becauſe it wanted the form and limits of a Night, for it wanted the ſhape of a twilight going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and therefore until it had obtained that, it was called no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but confuſed darknes, and it could not have this form til the laſt period of time belonging to the night was finiſhed; and it could not have that period till the firſt half of that twelve houres darkneſſe ſucceeding the Artificial Day had met with the firſt darkneſſe at the North point, and that conjunction occaſioned a mark of diſtinction in the middle of the night.</p>
                  <p>11. By theſe marks of diſtinction, the true Form and Figure of the two Lines of Longitude and Latitude, from Eaſt to Weſt, and from North to South, were clearly marked out.</p>
                  <p>12. By this Line of diviſion from Mid-day to Mid-night the Natural Day was again divided into two equal parts (in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner from the diviſion of the Day from the Night) the firſt half from Mid-day to Mid-night was called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, and the other half from Mid-night to Mid-day was called <hi>Boker,</hi> the Morning,</p>
                  <p>13. After this ſort hath the God of Nature halfed and quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Natural day by the Lines of Longitude and Latitude.</p>
                  <p>14 By this method the God of Nature hath not only made the natural day to be a twiparty day, conſiſting of light, and darkneſs; But alſo Secondly, He hath made the Artificial Day to be a twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party day, becauſe he hath made the one half of it to belong unto the Morning, and the other half of it to belong unto the Evening. Thirdly, He hath alſo made the Night to be a twiparty Night, becauſe he hath made the one half of it to belong unto the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the other half of it to belong unto the morning. And in this regard the night is ſometimes called nights in the plural number, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 2. Fourthly, He hath alſo made the Natural Evening to be a twiparty evening, becauſe it is a connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the latter half of the Day, to the firſt half of the Night; and in this reſpect it is called <hi>Gnereb,</hi> a connexion, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is called <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> the two Evenings, becauſe of the two parts of it. Fifthly, He hath alſo made the Natural Morning to be a twiparty Morning, becauſe it is a connexion of the firſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or of the latter half of the night, with the firſt half of the Artificial day, and in this reſpect it is often called Mornings in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36425:26"/>
plural number, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 8. <hi>Job</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 33. 2.</p>
                  <p>15. The Reaſon why the firſt darkneſſe could not be called either <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning, or <hi>Gnereb</hi> the Evening, at firſt, was, becauſe theſe names are names of the perfect ſhape and limits given unto theſe two parts of the Natural day; and the firſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was a confuſed miſ-ſhapen thing at firſt, therefore it could not belong either unto the Morning or unto the Evening, until it was firſt ſhaped and limited into a night; for <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning is conſtituted of a part of the ſhaped Night, as well as of a part of the ſhaped Artificial Day; and the firſt darkneſſe could not be ſhaped into a Night until it had twelve houres darkneſſe ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Artificial Day, by means whereof the firſt half had a Twilight going before it, and then as ſoon as it met with the firſt darkneſſe at the North point, it Firſt gave perfection of ſhape to the Night. And Secondly, It gave perfection of ſhape to the Evening. And thirdly, It gave perfection of ſhape to <hi>Boker</hi> the Morning.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly, every part of this day had its name as ſoon as it had its perfect ſhape; as for example, when the ſhining light had finiſhed its laſt period at the Weſt point, it was called Day; in like ſort, when the darkneſſe had finiſhed its laſt period at the North point, it was called Night: And then alſo the Evening and the Morning was the Firſt Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> were Twins, and when they came to their Birth, <hi>Zara</hi> thruſt out his hand firſt, thereupon the Midwiſe ſaid this is firſt, and ſhe did mark it out for the firſt by a red thred; yet notwithſtanding <hi>Pharez</hi> did finiſh his Birth firſt, and therupon he was firſt named <hi>Pharez,</hi> and <hi>Zara</hi> was laſt named though he begun his Birth firſt: Even ſo, the time called Morning began its birth firſt, but yet notwithſtanding the time called Evening was firſt perfected in its ſhape and limits, and thereupon it was firſt called <hi>Gnereb.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>FIrſt, It appears to me that the firſt Darkneſs was called <hi>Boker,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Boker</hi> the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie early.</note> the Morning, at laſt; namely, as ſoon as all the parts of the Natural Day were formed<hi>:</hi> Becauſe <hi>Boker,</hi> (the Morning) doth ſignifie Early, See <hi>Ainſ. in Pſal.</hi> 5. 4. and in this ſenſe the Morning is put for the firſt opportunity of time for any buſineſs, as in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God early by prayer, and in this ſenſe <hi>David</hi> ſaith in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Jehovah, in the morning</hi> (or early) <hi>I will direct my prayer unto thee, and will look out</hi> (or eſpie) as he that keepeth watch and ward expecting what God will anſwer; and the godly do often profeſſe, that they will look out early after God (by the term Morning) as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 14. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 8. and truly I conceive, that the onely Reaſon why Buls and Cows, And all the Herds of that kind are called <hi>Baker</hi> (from whence <hi>Boker</hi> is derived) is from their early ſeeking out for their meat from God, ſooner than other Cattle uſe to do: for in the Evening or in the beginning
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36425:27"/>
of the Night they uſe to ſit down and chew their Cud, but in the early Night-morning, they uſually riſe up and ſeek out for food before other ſorts of Cattle.</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. Boker, <hi>the Morning, is put for the beginning of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Day, becauſe that is the fitteſt ſeaſon to ſeek out or (earth after things that be loſt, or after things that are to be ſought after; men do not uſually ſeek after things in the dark, but as ſoon as the morning light appears, then they begin to look and ſearch after loſt things, and hence the beginning of the Artificiall Day is called</hi> Boker, <hi>the Morning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſee no Reaſon to reſtrain the ſignification of <hi>Boker</hi> to mans ſeeking by the ſight of his eyes, in the time of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Morning onely, but conſidering that <hi>Boker,</hi> the Morning, is placed among the works of Gods Creation before man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it may be conſidered as Gods firſt early time in ordering the Creation in the beſt manner; for God may be ſaid to ſeek early (after the manner of men) not for want of knowledge in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but to ſet out his Wiſdom and Prudence, and Fatherly care, and the like, in the firſt Creation, as theſe Scriptures do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 24. 27. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 11, 12, 16. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90. 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 176. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>by Wiſdom the Lord founded the Earth, and by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding he eſtabliſhed the Heavens, Prov.</hi> 3. 19. and ſo by Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he formed all the parts of the Firſt Day, in ſuch an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Order, that ſo it might be for an exemplary pattern to all the other Natural daies to the end of the world. Secondly, Early ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be done by advice, counſel, and meditation, as well in the time of darkneſſe, as in the morning light. Thirdly, When it pleaſed the Lord to uncreat <hi>Judah</hi> by his deſtroying Judgements (namely, by wars from the Enemy) how did God order it to be done? but by his early looking out and ſearching into things; For thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>I looked upon the Earth, and loe it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form and void, and to the Heavens, and they had no light,</hi> Jer. 4. 23. for by their wicked confuſed Government they had provoked the Lord by wars to turn all their Commonwealth into a Chaos a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. This form of ſpeech (by contraries) declares that God by his wiſe Providence did ſearch out in the time of the firſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs how to adorn the earth with light, and how to order all the parts of the firſt day in the beſt manner, and in this reſpect Gods early Providence is often ſet out by the term Morning, both in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36425:27"/>
regard of his early Judgements upon a people, and alſo in regard <note place="margin">Boker, the Morning, is put for Gods early ſeeking either to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or protect the godly.</note> of his early Preſervation of his own people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His early and ſpeedy Judgements upon the wicked are ſet out by the term Morning, in <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 14 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 7, 10. and ſo in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 15. In the morning ſhal the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be deſtroyed; and in this ſenſe I ſhall preſently expound <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The term Morning doth often denote Gods early care and Providence in looking out for the Protection of his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 7.</p>
                  <p>Hence I infer, that ſeeing the word Morning doth ſignifie early ſeeking, or early looking out, it may well denote unto us, that the firſt Darkneſs was not comprehended under the term Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but under the term Morning, for <hi>Gnereb,</hi> the Evening, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put for early or firſt, but it is always put for late or laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the latter part of the Day, as I have ſhewed in my Anſwer to the third Objection of the former Chapter, and more by and by.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is further evident that the Morning time was firſt, <note place="margin">As Gnereb the Evening is put for laſt time<hi>:</hi> So Boker the Morning is put for the firſt time, or for the beginning of a thing.</note> and the Evening laſt, by <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 27. <hi>Benjamin ſhall ravine like a Woolf, in the Morning he ſhall devour the prey, and in the Evening he ſhall divide the ſpoile;</hi> The Seventy render it, <hi>The early Morning;</hi> and truly, ſeeing the firſt Darkneſs had the priority of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Artificial Morning, it is not proper to put the Artificial Morning for firſt in preheminence of time before the firſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore in reaſon, the firſt Darkneſs muſt belong to the early Morning, as well as the firſt half of the Artificial Day doth, or elſe <hi>Jacob</hi> did not make a proper Alluſion to the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and to the Evening, if the firſt Darkneſs had been Evening, for then the evening had been firſt in order of time; ſearch into the ſtory of Events, and ſee how <hi>Jacobs</hi> Prophecie doth relate to the term Morning and Evening; the event of his P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

2. In the Evening-time of the world God raiſed up <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> to divide the ſpoil with the other Apoſtles, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, for <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to make the Word of God to abound from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illyricum, Rom.</hi> 15. 19. and it is further evident that the daies of the Goſpel are called the Evening, by <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 7. the Prophet doth there foretel that there ſhall be a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Jews (namely of the diſperſed Jews dwelling in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countries) that ſhall be called to reſt or lie down in the Evening, and to this remnant of diſperſed Jewes did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James</hi> write in the Evening-time of the Goſpel to exhort them to reſt and repoſe their Souls in Chriſt for Life and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zachary</hi> alſo doth uſe the term Evening for the laſt times, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the daies of the Goſpel, and in that reſpect the time of the Goſpel is often called the laſt dayes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. 20. <hi>Zacharies</hi> phraſe runs thus, <hi>In the Evening time it ſhall be light, Zach.</hi> 14. 7. It is very ſuitable to compare the laſt daies of the Goſpel to the Evening, becauſe it is the laſt half of the Natural Day; and it is moſt ſuitable alſo to compare the light of the Goſpel to the light of the Evening, for the Evening begins at Mid-day at the firſt declining of the Sun, and then the day is moſt clear and bright, and ſo it continues till almoſt Sun-ſet; and in the laſt days, when the Apoſtles had a Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel in all the world, the Goſpel gave a light moſt clear to many ſouls that ſat in darkneſs: But if the Evening had been no other time but the dark Night, as the moſt would have it, then <hi>Zacharies</hi> Alluſion to the light of that Evening, had been but a poor compariſon to ſet forth the light of the Goſpel, for in ſuch an Evening there is no other light but Star-light, or Moon-light at the beſt, and that is but a poor light to illuſtrate the light of the Goſpel by, in the days of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As the Evening is often put for laſt, ſo the Morning is put for firſt, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>The man Gabriel whom I had ſeen in a viſion at Firſt,</hi> or in the Morning, ſo the Hebrew ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is evident by another Alluſion that the Morning is before the Evening, becauſe the term Morning is put for the very firſt beginning of a thing; and in this ſenſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is moſt elegant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 11. Evill ſhall come upon thee (O <hi>Babylon)</hi> and thou ſhalt not know the morning thereof (or the beginning thereof.) The Hebrew word ſignifies the early Morning; but the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36425:28"/>
                     <hi>Geneva</hi> doth render it the Beginning; and by this phraſe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt did (by a Periphraſis) deſcribe the beginning of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> ruin by the early Morning.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>Good Divines do take the term Morning here for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Artificial Day, and the word Morning in that ſenſe doth not hinder, but that the firſt Darkneſs was Evening.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have already anſwered this Objection immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I told you there, that if the firſt Darkneſs had been called Evening, then doubtleſs the Evening would have been put for the firſt beginning of any thing, and the Morning for laſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Morning is put for the firſt beginning of a thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is out of all doubt to me, that the firſt Darkneſs did belong to the Morning and not to the Evening.</p>
                  <p>2. I anſwer further, that the Morning of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall cannot be ſo conveniently compared to the Morning of the Artificial day, as to the dark early morning; becauſe the Artificial Morning is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and perſpicuous to all men: But the ruin of <hi>Babylon</hi> was not perſpicuous at firſt, but it was carryed on in a ſpeedy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure manner by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> had no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition or diſcerning of their fall as yet; therefore the Morning of the Artificial Day was not ſo ſuitable to exemplifie the manner of their ſpeedy ruin, as the early dark Morning was, for it was done ſpeedily ere they were aware, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 24. as it appears by theſe two conſiderations.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Iſay</hi> did foretel that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed in the Night, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21. 4.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Iſay</hi> did foretel that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed in the early Morning, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 11.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Put both theſe Prophetical alluſions together, and then they wil amount to thus much, that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed in that Morning, that begins in the Night; and the Hiſtory of Events doth tell us, not onely that <hi>Belſhazzer</hi> was ſlain in the Night, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 30. but alſo it is apparent by the circumſtances of time that muſt be ſpent at that drunken feaſt before that <hi>Daniel</hi> could be ſought out and brought in, to interpret the viſion, that it was in the latter part of the Night, after the Morning was begun.</p>
                  <p>Take the early Morning of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall either in the former fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative ſenſe, or in the laſt proper ſenſe (either way or both wayes) and it doth ſufficiently prove, that the time called Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36425:29"/>
was firſt in order before the time called Evening, or elſe this Alluſion of <hi>Babylons</hi> fall to the early Morning had been improper; hence it follows, that the firſt Darkneſs was comprehended under the term Morning, and not under the term Evening.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning, is put for the firſt beginning of a <note place="margin">Fifthly, Boker, the morning, is put for the Sun-ſet Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe the time of Sun-ſet is the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Jews day of eleanneſles.</note> thing, becauſe it is put for the firſt beginning of the Jews Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial day (or for the Sun-ſet Evening) as the Hebrew Doctors do witneſs. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. This I have further opened in another place; and ſo in like ſort <hi>Macar,</hi> the morrow, is put for the firſt beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day (or for the Sun-ſet Evening) in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15. as it is further opened in chap. 4.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, It is evident that the morning was before the time called Evening by the title that <hi>Job</hi> gives to the Angels, he cals them <hi>Morning-Stars, Job</hi> 38. 6, 7. Theſe Morning-Stars cannot be meant of the Stars in the Firmament, for they were not created till the fourth day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. But theſe Morning-Stars are ſaid to ſhout and ſing when the foundation of the earth was laid; Hence it follows, that the Angels are called Morning-Stars, either becauſe of the time wherein they ſhouted at the firſt laying of the foundations of the earth, which was done in the time of the firſt darkneſs, or elſe in relation to the time of their Creation, which was alſo done in the time of the firſt darkneſs, as many learned do accord.</p>
                  <p>But if the time of their Creation, or the time wherein they ſhouted at the laying of the foundations of the earth had been Evening, then the Angels ſhould more properly have been called Evening-Stars, than Morning-Stars.</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. <hi>The Angels are called Morning-Stars, not in relation to the time of their Creation, but by way of alluſion to the excellency of their Nature, and this is more ſuitable to be expreſſed by the light of the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial morning, than by the firſt darkneſs.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Circumſtances of Gods diſcourſe with <hi>Job,</hi> and of Gods Interrogations be well marked, there is no ground to ſay that God did onely intend to ſet out the excellent nature of the Angels by comparing them to the morning of the Artificiall day.</p>
                  <p>For the main thing that God aimed at by his Interrogations to <hi>Job,</hi> was, to make him ſee his folly in deſiring to diſpute the cauſe of his afflictions with God, God ſhews him that he is not able to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36425:29"/>
find out the depths of his Wiſdom in the firſt laying of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the earth, becauſe it made the Angels to ſhout out with admiration, and therefore <hi>Job</hi> was much leſs able to ſearch out the reaſon of his dealings with him, in his preſent afflictions, and in that reſpect God did poſe him with this Interrogation, <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundation of the earth, tell, if thou have underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Job 38. 4, 5, 6. <hi>When the morning Stars rejoyced together, and when the Sons of God ſhouted,</hi> Ver. 7. The Text doth plainly call them Morning Stars, not ſo much in regard of the excellency of their Nature, but in regard of the time wherein they were created, or wherein they ſhouted at the excellency of Gods Workmanſhip when the foundation of the earth was laid, either way or both waies do aſſure us that the time of the firſt darkneſs was called Morning and not Evening. And that is the thing that I aim at in this firſt Section of this Chapter.</p>

                  <head>SECT. 2. <hi>Proving that the Morning doth begin in the dark Night.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>FIrſt, No man can deny but that the Morning is begun when the morning Watch is begun, for the text doth affirm it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 24. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 11. And it is a known thing, that among the Jews they did alwaies begin it juſt three hours after Midnight, not onely in the Summer time but alſo in the Winter time: Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that their morning Watch in the time of Winter muſt needs begin in the dark night, not onely in <hi>Judea,</hi> but alſo in all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable parts of the world.</p>
                  <p>2. Hence it follows, that ſeeing the morning Watch did begin at three hours after Mid-night, then it will follow, that it muſt end juſt three hours after Mid-day; for in common reaſon the morning muſt be as long as the evening, namely, twelve hours long, or elſe the Evening may better be called an Unevening, then an Evening to the Morning; but none that have their ſenſes will ſay that the morning doth continue till three hours after Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
                  <p>3 Hence it follows, that it is more agreeable to Scripture and to common reaſon to begin the natural morning at the marked time of Mid-night, rather than three hours after, eſpecially ſeeing it is then as dark all the winter long as it is at Mid-night, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36425:30"/>
therefore ſeeing the morning is begun with darkneſs, why not with darkneſs at mid-night, as well as at three hours after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, ſeeing the world was created in the Equinoctial, and the Morning is then as dark at three hours after Mid-night, as it is at Mid-night?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Ruth</hi> lay at the feet of <hi>Boaz</hi> until the Morning, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 3. 14. and yet ſhe aroſe before one could know another. Hence it is evident that it was Morning in the time of Barly Harveſt, whiles it was yet dark; it may be it was now in the end of our <hi>March,</hi> or in the beginning of our <hi>April;</hi> and though ſome ſay that the Morning Watch was not ſo called from the firſt hour of it, but from the laſt hour of it when it begun to be day light; yet this place of <hi>Ruth</hi> cals it Morning whiles it was yet dark, and before one could know another.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is ſaid that Chriſt aroſe in the Morning <hi>a great while before Day</hi> (or greatly in the Night) ſo the Greek ſpeaks, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 35. Hence it is manifeſt that it was Morning, whiles it was greatly or much in the night.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, None can deny but that the morning is begun at the time of day-break in all the Inhabited Countries of the world. Hence it follows, that then it is morning in ſome Countries near unto mid-night, eſpecially when the daies are at the longeſt; and known experience doth tell us that in the North parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the day doth ſometimes begin to break near unto mid-night; and indeed the day-light (when the daies are at the longeſt) is ſcarſe ever out of the Sky in thoſe parts, except a little while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mid-night; Hence it follows, that ſeeing it is day-break ſometimes near unto Mid-night, then why may not the morning begin at mid-night all the year long as well in one Country as in another, ſeeing the God of Nature hath ſet ſuch an eminent mark upon mid-night, and upon mid-day, which doubtleſs was to ſet out the bounds and limits of the Natural morning, and of the evening?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Both Scripture and experience doth tell us that there is a certain Star called the Morning Star, which at ſome time of the year is ſeen to ariſe not long after Mid-night, and all men call it morning as ſoon as that Star is riſen, and in ſome parts when the daies are at the longeſt it riſeth near unto Mid-night, but it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies riſeth before it is day break.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:36425:30"/>
Sixthly, It is evident that the morning begins in the dark night, by this phraſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. <hi>The womb of the early Morning;</hi> I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to meddle with the myſtical ſenſe of theſe words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it concerns not the Argument in hand; but I will onely meddle with the phraſe, for the phraſe ſake onely; for this phraſe muſt have ſome proper alluſion to ſome natural truth: <hi>Mibſchar,</hi> we tranſlate Morning, but ſaith Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> the letter <hi>M</hi> is a Prepoſition, ſignifying <hi>[From</hi> or <hi>Before]</hi> and in that reſpect ſome tranſlators do render the text thus, <hi>Before the womb of the early Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> this phraſe muſt have an alluſion to ſome proper truth, and I can find nothing that may ſo fitly be called the womb of the early Morning, as the firſt darkneſs was, for out of this darkneſs God created the morning light, and in this reſpect the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may well be divided into ſeveral degrees of time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The firſt Darkneſs was the womb of the Morning light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From the womb of the morning proceeded the Son of the morning, called the morning Star, as ſoon as it was created, and it is now called the Son of the morning, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then follows the aſcending of the morning or day-break, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24, 26.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Then follows the time of killing the morning Sacrifice, namely, when the face of all the Eaſt is inlightned, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween day-break and Sun-riſing, See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 4. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that the morning Sacrifice was not onely ſlain, but alſo offered before Sun-riſing, (becauſe the Meat Offering which was alwaies offered after the Burnt Offering) was offered before Sun riſing, as it appears by 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 20, 22. and the Burnt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was alwaies firſt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. and then the Meat Offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2. now though the Morning Sacrifice was offered before Sun-riſing, yet the Evening Sacrifices of all ſorts muſt be offered before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. For the Hebrew Doctors ſay, that after Sun-ſet the blood of all Sacrifices became unlawful, See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Then follows the morning of the Artificiall day at Sun-riſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 22, 23. for God did appoint the Sun to rule and limit the Artificiall day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then followed the time of morning Prayer at the third hour of the day, namely at our nine a clock.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By theſe gradations to the morning we may ſee the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their opinion that hold no other time to be called the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36425:31"/>
properly, but a point of time onely, at the beginning of the Artificial day, all the reſt they ſay is called the morning impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By theſe gradations to the morning it is evident that the firſt darkneſs was the root or womb of the morning, and therefore at laſt it was called Morning.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 3. <hi>Proving that the Morning in all likelihood doth begin at mid-night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the former certain grounds from the exact beginning and ending of the Evening.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>FIrſt, I will endeavor to prove that the morning doth begin at mid-night by an argument drawn from <hi>Job</hi> 26. 7. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, That <hi>God ſtretcheth out the North upon the empty;</hi> and ſaith <hi>Moſes, The Earth was empty and void,</hi> namely, as long as darkneſs was upon the face of the deep; But as ſoon as the light was created, the earth could not be ſaid to be empty and void any longer, for then the deep was adorned with the light as with a moſt glorious ornament.</p>
                  <p>Object. 4. <hi>The firſt Darkneſs did continue twelve hours upon the face of the deep, after the general matter called Earth was created: Or thus, how long was the Earth empty and void before the light was created?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer is from <hi>Job,</hi> That the Earth was empty and void all the ſpace of time that the North point is ſtretched out upon a Compaſs Dial, namely, the ſpace of ſix hours, for the North point on a Compaſs Dial doth ſtretch it ſelf out untill it meet with the beginning of the Eaſt point, the four ends of the two Lines of Longitude and Latitude do make the four Cardinal Points of the Compaſs, North, Eaſt, South, and Weſt: Hence it follows, that the North point is ſtretched out to the Eaſt point, and that is juſt ſix hours by the Compaſs Dyal, and ſo long ſaith <hi>Job</hi> the Globe was empty; but as ſoon as God created Light out of Darkneſs, which began to appear by degrees, firſt, By a Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and then ſhined forth at the Eaſt point, then the Earth was no longer empty and void, but it was adorued with the light.</p>
                  <p>If any man can give a better Interpretation, for the ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the North upon the Empty, I ſhall bee glad to ſee it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:36425:31"/>
But if the firſt Darkneſs had been twelve hours long, then <hi>Job</hi> ſhould have ſaid, that God ſtretched out the Weſt point, as well as the North point upon the Empty: but <hi>Job</hi> doth not ſay ſo, but only that he ſtretched out the North upon the Empty, and therefore it follows,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That the firſt Darkneſs was not twelve hours, but only ſix hours long upon the face of the deep, before the light was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hence it follows, that the firſt half of that twelve hours Darkneſs that ſucceeded the Artificial Day, did make up the firſt darkneſs to be a juſt Night of twelve hours, and after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both theſe parts of Darkneſs did meet together at the North point, as I have exemplified the matter upon a Compaſs Dyal, and the North Land in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 8. may according to the Hebrew be read from the Land of darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>And why elſe doth the Prophet in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 12. begin the time of the firſt Creation in order from the North point, but to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us, where, and how long the darkneſs did continue upon the face of the deep after the Earth was created, before the light was created?</p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe for this Reaſon, <hi>Job</hi> doth teach us in what order we muſt place the four ends of the two Lines of Latitude and Longitude (now called the foure Cardinall Points of the Compaſs) by placing a man in this order to view the Globe.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 He calleth the North point, the left hand.</item>
                     <item>2 He calleth the South point, the right hand.</item>
                     <item>3 He calleth the Eaſt point, before.</item>
                     <item>4 He calleth the Weſt point, behind. See <hi>Tremelius</hi> for this in <hi>Job</hi> 23. 89.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>So then, He that deſires to behold the Globe in a right order, how the God of Nature did divide it and quarter it, muſt place the North point of the Globe at his left hand, the Eaſt before, the South at his right hand, and the Weſt behind. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 13. and in <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. 3, 29.</p>
                  <p>2 The holy Scriptures do often direct us to obſerve the foure ends of the two Lines of Latitude and Longitude.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 Becauſe they divide the whole earth into four quarters.</item>
                     <item>2 Becauſe they divide the heavens into four quarters.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And in this reſpect the four quarters of the Earth are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36425:32"/>
called the four wings, or the four corners of the Earth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Job</hi> 37. 3. and 38. 13.</p>
                  <p>2 The Heavens are divided into four quarters, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the four Winds are ſaid to come from the four quarters of Heaven, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49. 36. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 2. and 8. 2. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31.</p>
                  <p>And when the Lines of Latitude and Longitude are drawn upon a Compaſs Dyal or upon a Globe, then they make the four winds in the four quarters of Heaven to lie thus, and to be called thus, North-Eaſt, South-Eaſt, South-weſt, North-weſt.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Holy Scripture doth force us to obſerve the various uſe of theſe two Lines of Longitude and Latitude; and therefore doubtleſs <hi>Job</hi> was not ignorant, but ſpake as a man of knowledge, when he ſaid that God ſtretched out the North up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Empty. Firſt, He was not ignorant of the North point. Nor ſecondly, How far it ſtretched. Nor thirdly, of the time of the Globes emptineſs.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth direct us to take notice of the North point as the firſt in order of the ſour Cardinal points, becauſe he doth firſt begin the diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> from the North quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo he ends it with the Weſt quarter, read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. from ver. 15. to the end of the Chapter; and in this order alſo the Lord was pleaſed to let <hi>Moſes</hi> take a view of the land, he ſtood in the Land of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and from thence in the firſt place he viewed <hi>Dan</hi> which was the furtheſt Northward and Northally in <hi>Galilee,</hi> which lay alſo Northward. Secondly, Then he viewed the land of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and half <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> which lay Eaſtward from him in the middle of the Land. Thirdly, Then he viewed the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> to the South. And fourthly, Then he viewed the Land of <hi>Jerico</hi> which lay in the Weſt of <hi>Canaan.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will indeavor to prove that the Morning began with the firſt darkneſs, and that the firſt darkneſs muſt be placed at the North point by another phraſe of <hi>Job,</hi> for <hi>Job</hi> doth tell us that when the winds have purged the Air, and made it clear from clouds and vapours, that then out of the North a golden light doth ſhew it ſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 37. 22. Our eie-ſight may witneſs the truth of this point, for in a clear Morning before Sun-riſing we may often ſee a golden liſt of light ſtretching it ſelf from the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36425:32"/>
North point to the Eaſt; and again after Sun-ſet we may often ſee a golden liſt of light ſtretching it ſelf from the Weſt point to the North point. This Obſervation, Firſt, Of the golden liſt from North to Eaſt, may teach us that the root of the Morning comes from the North point, where the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night begins by the Compaſs-Dyall. And Secondly, The gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den liſt in the Evening after Sun-ſet from Weſt to North, may teach us that the Evening doth reach unto Mid-night, or to the North point.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I prove that the Natural Morning doth being at Mid-night, becauſe the morning of the fifteenth day of <hi>Niſhan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at Mid-night.</p>
                  <p>I collect it thus, <hi>Moſes</hi> at the firſt paſſeover in <hi>Egypt</hi> gave a very ſtrict charge to all the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that no man ſhould go out of the door of his houſe untill the Morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 22. name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not untill the morning of the fifteenth day was come; this was <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſs charge. Hence I reaſon thus, if any man of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had gone out of the door of his houſe before the morning of the fifteenth day was truely come, contrary to this charge (as thoſe did that went out of the door of their houſes to gather Manna on the Sabbath-day morning) they would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Tranſgreſſors for it (as they were that gathered Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na on the Sabbath day morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 27. 28.)</p>
                  <p>But all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of the doors of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes either at Mid-night or preſently after, as it appears by ver. 33. and 39. and yet none of them were condemned as tranſgreſſors for it: But on the contrary, their exact obedience to all <hi>Moſes</hi> commands is twice over teſtified in ver. 28. and twice over again in ver. 50. The Text ſaith, they did all things as God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſo did they, Even as exactly as <hi>Noah</hi> did in making the Arke, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 22. or as <hi>Moſes</hi> did in making the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 16. for their obedience is alike ſet out by the ſame double expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing all the people were thus exact in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all <hi>Moſes</hi> commands; it follows, that they did not go out of the doors of their houſes untill the morning of the fifteenth day was come, and yet they went out of the doors of their houſes at Mid-night, or preſently after, becauſe they knew that the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fifteenth day was begun at Mid-night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:36425:33"/>
Yea, It is evident that <hi>Moſes</hi> intended they ſhould all go out of their doors in the Morning preſently after Mid-night, becauſe he had foretold them, that all the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould be ſlain at Mid-night, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. 4, 5. And ſecondly, He had foretold them that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> would thruſt them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> v. 1. and that the Nobles would come and bow down to <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaying, <hi>Go thou out and all the people at thy feet, Exod.</hi> 11. 8. Yea, <hi>Moſes</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for a ſudden departing from their houſes, becauſe he commanded to eat the Paſſeover with their loyns girded, with their ſhooes on their feet, and with their ſtaves in their hands, and to eat it in haſte, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. all theſe things do teſtifie that <hi>Moſes</hi> intended they ſhould go out of the doors of their houſes as ſoon as ever the morning of the fifteenth day was come, and he meant it was come as ſoon as Midnight was come.</p>
                  <p>Object. 5. <hi>I grant that all</hi> Iſrael <hi>departed out of</hi> Egypt <hi>on the fifteenth day of</hi> Niſhan, Numb. 33. 3. <hi>But how prove you that they began their journey at Midnight, or that the fifteenth day began at Mid-night?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The circumſtances of the Text do prove it plain enough; for as ſoon as the <hi>Egyptiaus</hi> ſaw all their firſt-born ſlain at Mid-night, they feared leſt they ſhould be all ſlain, and therefore they did urge the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in all haſte to depart, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> knew all this before-hand, and accordingly they prepared for their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy departure, and becauſe of this their preparation they are ſaid to depart out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the night, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 1. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 29, 31, 42. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> therefore as ſoon as their firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born were ſlain at Midnight, urged the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in haſte to depart, and then alſo the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did depart out of the doors of their houſes, becauſe the morning of the fifteenth day was come, but yet they could not fully depart out of <hi>Egypt</hi> untill the body of the ſelf ſame day was come, namely, not till it was Mid-day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 41. they had many buſineſſes to do after they went out of the doors of their houſes before they could ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart; for they muſt aſſemble together 600000 men befides wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, and many connexed people and cattle, and before all this could be put into a fit poſture for their orderly marching away, it was Mid-day, and yet they made extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry haſte to bring things thus ſoon to paſſe, and through their great haſte they took their Dough as it was unleavened, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it upon their ſhoulders, ver. 34. and thenceforth the fifteenth

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Proving, That the Jewes Cuſtom in beginning their weekly Sabbath at the Sun-ſet Evening, was occaſioned by their Ceremonial Cuſtom, namely, Becauſe the perſons that were ceremonially purified from their ceremonial Defilements, were commanded to begin their new day of cleanneſs then; and hence it follows, firſt, That that accidental beginning of the Day muſt not be accounted for the true beginning of the Natural Day; And Secondly, Hence it follows, That it is not the right time for us Chriſtians to begin our Lords Day at the Sun-ſet Evening, as the Jews did by their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Cuſtom onely.</hi>

                  <p>THe Jews were often guilty of ſundry degrees of ſins of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs againſt the Ceremonial Law (beſides their ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Moral Law) as you may find them noted and diſtinguiſhed by Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 32. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 12. 6. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 7. compared with <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 10. and with <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. 6. and ſee alſo <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 9, 17. and <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 2, 3. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 2, 7, 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Anſwerable thereunto, the Ceremonial Law did ordain ſeveral degrees of purification, from theſe ſeveral degrees of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial uncleanneſs; as you may find them noted alſo by <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 9, 15. <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. 14. <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Num.</hi> 19. 18. <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2. and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Not onely the manner how, but alſo the time when they muſt cleanſe themſelves, was ordained and appointed by the Ceremonial Law.</p>
                  <p>Some kind of defilements might be clenſed in one day, but the greateſt degrees of their Ceremonial defilements required not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, but many dayes for their cleanſing; but all were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to begin their cleanſing in the Evening in two degrees of time, according to the two parts of the Evening, for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36425:34"/>
Evening hath two equal parts (as I have ſhewed in Chap. 2. and ſhall further ſhew it in the next Chapter.)</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Evening (which doth always begin at Mid-day) they muſt baptize or waſh themſelves. <note place="margin">The Jews were cleanſed from their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1. By waſhing in the afternoon; And 2. By the Suns ſetting upon them after their bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Evening (which doth alwaies begin at Sun-ſet) they did begin to date the day of their cleanneſs.</p>
                  <p>For by the ſetting of the Sun upon them, after their waſhing, two things were effected; Firſt, Their cleanneſs by their former waſhing was confirmed or made perfect; And ſecondly, As ſoon as their cleanneſs was made perfect, they began the day of their cleanneſs.</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>Might not the unclean perſon baptize himſelf from his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial defilements in the latter evening after Sun-ſet, as well as in the time of the firſt Evening before Sun-ſet?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> He might not, becauſe God had appointed the time of the two Evenings for two diſtinct degrees of their cleanſing<hi>:</hi> The firſt Evening from Mid-day to Sun-ſet was allotted to them for the waſhing or baptizing themſelves from their ceremonial ſins, and this was onely as a preparation to the day of their cleanneſs, And this I will labor to make evident ſeveral waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 11. doth command the unclean perſon to bath himſelf in water, <hi>at the looking forth of the Evening.</hi> So the Hebrew phraſe is, but it may be demanded, what time is that, that is meant by the looking forth of the Evening?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſhewed you in chap. 2. and in chap. 5. that the Evening doth firſt begin at the firſt declining of the Sun at Mid-day, and that it looks forth towards his ſetting in the weſt from the very firſt declining of the Sun from Mid-day untill it depart from that Horizon, and to this ſenſe I have expounded the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Evening to look forth, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 6, 4. See Chap. 2.</p>
                  <p>In like ſort it is ſaid of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> that he went out into the fields to meditate <hi>at the looking forth of the Evening,</hi> Gen. 24. 63. In thoſe daies they had no private upper Rooms to meditate in, becauſe they lived in Tents, and therefore they uſed to ſequeſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by going out into the fields to meditate, where they had Groves of Trees for ſhade and refreſhing, and thither the godly uſed to go to meditate or to ſtudy divine myſteries in the heat of the day, at the firſt looking forth of the Evening. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 55. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:36425:35"/>
In like ſort, they uſed to bathe or baptize themſelves from their Ceremonial defilements at the looking forth of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then alſo the water was well warmed by the Sun, and ſo made the more fit for bathing. I grant alſo, that it was lawfull for them to bathe themſelves from their Ceremonial defilements all the time that the Sun looked forth by his ſhadowes towards the Weſt, till it was ready to depart out of that Horizon. But this is to be marked, that none were commanded to baptize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any part of the morning (onely the Prieſts were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to waſh their hands and their feet every morning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were clean before. See <hi>Ainſ. in Exod.</hi> 30. 19, 20.) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they commanded to baptize themſelves after Sun-ſet, for except they were baptized before Sun-ſet, they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the day of their cleanneſſe at Sun-ſet, according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is evident, that the appointed ſeaſon for baptizing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all their Ceremonial defilements was in the time of the firſt Evening, by the Example of <hi>Bathſhebaes</hi> baptizing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Text ſaith, it was in the Evening when <hi>David aroſe from his bed and walked upon the Roof of the Kings houſe,</hi> then <hi>he ſaw a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man waſhing her ſelf, and the woman was very beautiful to look upon,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. 2. This Evening when <hi>David</hi> aroſe from his bed, cannot be underſtood of the latter Sun-ſet Evening, for then for want of Sun-light he could not have diſcerned her beauty from the Roof of his houſe, but it muſt be underſtood of the afternoon Evening; for in thoſe hot Countries they uſed to ſleep in the afternoon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Bed or Pallat, as <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 5. from whence he aroſe and walked upon the flat Roof of his houſe, and thence he beheld the beauty of <hi>Bathſheba</hi> as ſhe was baptizing her ſelf; hence it may be gathered, that the unclean perſons did uſe to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize themſelves from their Ceremonial defilements in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Evening.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is alſo evident, that they baptized themſelves in the after-noon Evening from their Ceremonial defilements by a famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. for when the Lords wrath was gone out againſt them, in that the men of <hi>Ai</hi> ſlew about thirty ſix of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Achan</hi> had ſtoln the excommunicate thing; then ſaid the Lord to <hi>Joſhua</hi> at the Even-tide, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p, and ſanctifie the people, and</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:36425:35"/>
                     <hi>ſay, Sanctifie your ſelves againſt to morrow,</hi> Joſh. 7. 6, 13, 14, 15. and how elſe muſt they ſanctifie themſelves for the Lords preſence at his Ark on the morrow, but by waſhing themſelves from their Ceremonial defilements, for there were ſcarſe any but they were defiled by one accident or other, and none might come before the Lords Ark in their Ceremonial defilements upon pain of being cut off; and before <hi>Joſhua</hi> could make proclamation through the Camp for their purification, and for their ſolemn meeting to ſeek the Lord for mercy on the morrow, it would require a good ſpace of time, therefore this Evening cannot be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Evening, but of the noon-tide Evening, as I have explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the matter more at large in Chap. 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 All <hi>Iſrael</hi> were warned when ever they came before the Lords preſence in his Tabernacle, to be cleanſed from their Ceremonial defilements, eſpecially at their three ſolemn feaſts; but they were not tyed to the obſervation of their Ceremonial baptizing when they reſorted to their Synagogues on their weekly Sabbath daies, for in thoſe places both the clean and the unclean might meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Gods worſhip, as I have opened the matter in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Jews Synagogues Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>But under pain of the Lords diſpleaſure none might approach to the Lords Sanctuary without their legal purificati<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ons, as it is manifeſt by the example of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſome of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> &amp; <hi>Manaſſes</hi> when they came to the Paſſeover in the daies of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> with out their purifications; but as ſoon as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their error (which doubtleſs the conſciences of the viſited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons made them to acknowledge) he prayed to the Lord for them, &amp; the Lord was intreated, and healed the people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 19, 20. and for the better avoiding of this error afterwards, it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a cuſtom among the Jews, to go out of the Country up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before the Feaſt of Paſſeover, to purifie themſelves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 55. which purification was effected by two degrees of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Firſt, By baptizing themſelves in the firſt Evening; And ſecondly, By the Sun-ſetting upon them after their baptizing (as I have formerly proved the matter) for none might approach the Sanctuary until they could declare their purification to the Prieſts that were the Porters, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 19. as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 26.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord did ſo much approve of their Ceremonial pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both by their actual baptizing and by their abſtinence from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36425:36"/>
unclean meats, and from all other things elſe that might defile them: That for that very obedience he doth cal the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">All Iſrael are called men of Holineſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ceremonial purity.</note> 
                     <hi>Men of holineſs, Exod.</hi> 22. 31. for all the Nation in general were very careful to maintain this kind of holineſs. And the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors ſay, that if any man of the common people did but ſay, I am clean to keep the ſin-water, he was to be truſted, for there is no man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> too vild for it, See <hi>Ainſ. in Num.</hi> 19. 9. that is to ſay, no man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was too vild for it, if he were but Ceremonially clean; and in this ſenſe all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were holy, namely, to the purifying of their fleſh; <hi>for the Law is not of Faith, Gal.</hi> 3. 12. a man might keep the Law to the purifying of his fleſh, though they wanted ſaving-Faith to apply the blood of Chriſt for the cleanſing of their conſciences from the guilt of ſin.</p>
                  <p>And thus much touching the firſt degree of time in which they muſt perform the firſt degree of their Ceremonial clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 2.</head>
                  <p>I Come now to ſpeak of the ſecond degree of time wherein their Ceremonial cleanneſs was perfected, and that was as ſoon as the Sun was ſet upon them after their Ceremonial baptizing, and from that time alſo they began to date the new day of their cleanneſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I prove that God ordained the Sun-ſet Evening to be the time of perfecting the cleanneſs of the baptized perſon, ere he <note place="margin">None were compleatly purified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized til the Sun was ſet upon them.</note> could begin the day of his cleanneſs, by <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 10, 11. There <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith thus to all <hi>Iſrael, If there be in thee a man that is not clean by reaſon of an accident in the night, then he ſhall go out of the Camp; and he ſhall hath himſelf in water at the looking forth of the Evening</hi> (and what then, was he now made clean as ſoon as ever he had bathed himſelf in water? The anſwer is, no, hee muſt yet ſtay a while longer without the Camp till his Sun be ſet,) <hi>and then when the Sun is gon down he ſhall come into the Camp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is evident that his Ceremoniall purity was not compleat until his Sun was ſet, but then it was compleat, and therefore he did then begin to date the day of his cleanneſs.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo I gather, that their Ceremonial baptizing might be done in any part of the afternoon, provided it were done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36425:36"/>
Sun-ſet, becauſe the Sun did look forth towards the place of his going down by his ſhadow, from Mid-day, til it went out of that Horizon, as I have formerly explained the matter.</p>
                  <p>But if any were defiled by any accident in the night after his Sun was ſet upon him, he muſt remain in that uncleanneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a new baptizing in the next afternoon, and till a new Sun-ſet Evening,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is evident, that none were compleatly purified till Sun-ſet, by <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>If any man</hi> (whether Prieſt or Iſraelite) <hi>be made unclean by touching a dead creeping thing,</hi> (or the like unclean thing;) Then (in ver. 6.) <hi>he ſhall be unclean untill the Evening, he ſhall not eat of the holy things.</hi> But firſt, He ſhall bath himſelf in water. And then Secondly (ſaith ver. 7.) when <hi>the Sun is gon down he ſhall be clean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Text it is alſo evident, that he did not attain to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ceremonial cleanneſs by baptizing himſelf in water, untill the Sun was gon down upon him after his bathing: But as ſoon as his Sun was ſet, then he was compleatly purified, and then alſo he began to date the day of his cleanneſs, and then alſo he might eat of the holy things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Hebrew Doctors do abundantly teſtifie that no baptized perſon did begin the day of his cleanneſs untill his Sun was ſet; for this is their common and peculiar phraſe, <hi>They ſhall be unclean untill their Sun be ſet:</hi> But the common phraſe of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law ſaith thus, <hi>They ſhall be unclean untill the Evening. The unclean</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maymony) may not eat of the Heave-Offering untill their Sun be ſet.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ. in Lev.</hi> 22. 9, 10. And hence it is evident, that they held the baptized perſons to have ſome degree of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs upon them, untill their Sun was ſet: And therefore <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus; He that is baptized is the ſecond in unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, untill his Sun be ſet; And he that is ſo baptized (if his Sun bee not ſet) may not eat or drink of the <hi>Trumah</hi> (or holy offerings) nor of any meat or drink that is holy. See <hi>Ainſ. in Lev.</hi> 11. 32. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 20, 21. and in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 19, 20, 21. This phraſe in the Law, <hi>He ſhall be unclean untill the Evening,</hi> is eight times over repeated in <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. and fourteen times over in <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. and often elſewhere: But the Hebrew Doctors do uſually expreſs it, <hi>He ſhall be unclean till his Sun be ſet;</hi> they accounted the term Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet and the term Evening to be all one time. Hence then it follows,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36425:37"/>
that the date of their new day of cleanneſs did alwaies begin at the Sun-ſet Evening.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is evident, that the Jews began the date of their new day of cleanneſs at the Sun-ſet Evening; becauſe the Sun-ſet <note place="margin">The Jews mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row began at Sun-ſet in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note> Evening is called <hi>[Their morning]</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. <hi>David</hi> and his men are ſaid to purſue after the <hi>Amalekites, From the twilight unto the Evening of Their Morrow;</hi> that is to ſay, from the Twilight in the Morning until their Morrow, which began at the Sun-ſet Evening; it was a cuſtom that was proper and peculiar unto them, &amp; differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from other Nations, to date the new day of their cleanneſs from the Sun-ſet Evening; and therefore the Hebrew Text doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the word <hi>Their</hi> unto <hi>David</hi> and his men in ſpecial, calling it <hi>their morrow;</hi> Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> doth explain the word <hi>Morrow</hi> to be the next day after <hi>David</hi> &amp; his men were ſet forth to purſue the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> But the text doth not ſay ſo, but that <hi>David and his men fell upon the Amalekites and purſued their victory, from the Twilight</hi> (in the morning) <hi>untill the Evening of their morrow,</hi> that is, till the Sun-ſet Evening, for at that Evening began their Morrow, or their new day to the perſon purified.</p>
                  <p>2. It is evident that the Sun-ſet Evening was the Jews morrow, from the time of their reckoning of the ſeven weeks to the day of Penticoſt.</p>
                  <p>They are commanded to begin that reckoning <hi>from the morrow of the Sabbath;</hi> meaning by the Sabbath, the firſt day of the feaſt of unleavened bread, which God commanded them to obſerve as a Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15. And by the <hi>Morrow</hi> of the Sabbath, is meant the ſecond day of the Feaſt of unleavened bread, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the Sun-ſet Evening, at the end of the firſt day, that Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is called the Morrow, (but this is obſervable alſo, that the ſeventh day of the Feaſt of unleavened bread did not end at Sun-ſet; but the holy feaſt of that day continued in the night time after Sun-ſet) and in this ſenſe the word <hi>Morrow</hi> muſt be underſtood in ver. 11. and 16.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew Doctors ſay, they begin this reckoning from the beginning of the day (not from the beginning of the Artificial day as moſt are apt to miſtake their meaning, but) from the night of the ſixteenth of <hi>Niſhan.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ. in Lev.</hi> 23. 15. and it is a known thing (as I have explained the matter) that they did account the night to begin at the Sun-ſet Evening according to the date of the perſon purified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:36425:37"/>
And in this ſenſe the phraſe of <hi>The next day</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 62. muſt be underſtood; then, the next day that followed the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, muſt be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Evening.</p>
                  <p>3. As <hi>Boker,</hi> the Morning, is put for the beginning of the day, namely, for the beginning of the Natural day, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Artificial day; ſo alſo, it is once put for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Jews Ceremonial day, or for the Sun-ſet Evening, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. as I have opened the matter more at large in Chap. 5.</p>
                  <p>Theſe places do plainly evidence that the Jews had a double Morning, and a double Morrow (as they had a double year) anſwerable to the Natural Day and to their Ceremonial Day.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>Though I am willing to grant that all purified perſons did</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">It is diſputed by ſome that the Sun-ſet Evening is not fully come until it be full Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what paſt, or elſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it cannot be proved that Chriſt lay three daies in his grave.</note> 
                     <hi>begin the date of their new Day at the Sun-ſet Evening, yet learned men do affirm, that the Sun is not ſet as ſoon as the Body of the Sun is gone out of our ſight; They ſay that as long as there doth remain any light in the Skie the Sun is the cauſe of it, and hence they aſſert, That the Sun is not ſet untill the Darkneſs in the Skie is more than the Light in the Skie; they ſay the Sun is not ſet untill it is full Twilight or ſomewhat paſt: and by this expoſition of the Sun-ſet Evening, they ſay it may be proved that Chriſt lay three daies in his Grave, or elſe they confeſſe it cannot be proved.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this grand Objection (which is very great in ſome mens eyes) be fully anſwered, then all the Concluſions that are built upon it muſt needs fall to the ground with it.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs I cannot but wonder that any learned men ſhould make the time of Sun-ſet and the time of Twilight to be all one, for if this be true, then all Aſtronomers muſt go to School again to learn better how to ſet the Minutes of the Suns riſing and of the Suns ſetting. But ſee what I ſay further in anſwer to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Chap. 7.</p>
                  <p>And ſuppoſe a man that holds thus, ſhould hire a laborer to <note place="margin">That the time of Sun-ſet is fully come as ſoon as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Sun is gon out of ſight, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</note> work in his Garden from Sun-riſing till Sun-ſet, and ſuppoſe this Laborer do contract with him to continue at his labor until the preciſe time of Sun-ſet, and accordingly he continues at his labor untill the Body of the Sun is gon out of ſight, and then he leaves off and takes witneſs of it, and preſently goes to his Maſter for wages according to Contract; his Maſter refuſeth to pay him becauſe he did not continue at his labor until the preciſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36425:38"/>
time of Sun-ſet; he tels him, that the Sun is not yet ſet, becauſe the Light in the Sky is more in quantity than the Darkneſs; for ſaith he, the Sun is the cauſe of that light, and therefore it is not yet ſet, and he takes witneſs, and ſo they part in diſcontent; and becauſe they could not agree about the preciſe time of Sun-ſet, they refer this controverſie to be determined by competent Judges.</p>
                  <p>And firſt let <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhew his Judgement, what he means by the time of Sun-ſet, or by the Suns going down, for he doth ſhew his judgement by a familiar example; He directed the Jews how to find out Mount <hi>Gerezim</hi> on the other ſide <hi>Jordan, It lies</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>behind the way, at the going down of the Sun, Deut.</hi> 11. 30. In theſe words <hi>Moſes</hi> doth give them a twofold mark of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It lies behind,</hi> 2. <hi>It lies at the going down of the Sun,</hi> and I have ſhewed you in expounding <hi>Job</hi> 23. 8, 9. that this phraſe <hi>behind</hi> is often put for the Weſt. And in this ſenſe alſo ſee <hi>Ainſ. in Gen.</hi> 14. 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>It lies at the going down of the Sun;</hi> if you ſay this going down of the Sun is not meant of the place where the body of the Sun goes out of ſight, but of the place of Twilight, then whither might the Jews wander by that mark of direction to ſeek out Mount <hi>Gerezim?</hi> For when the darkneſs in the Skie is ſomewhat more than the light in the Sky, the Jews might wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into the North or into the South as well as into the Weſt, for the time and place of Twilight is but an uncertain mark to ſteer their courſe by to Mount <hi>Gerezim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to place the time of Sun-ſet where the body of the Sun goes out of ſight, is a perſpicuous mark for the Weſt (when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, as it was when this direction was given) and in this reſpect the time of Sun-ſet is often put for the Weſt. See more in Chap. 2. in anſwer to Objection 3. And ſee <hi>Ainſ. in Pſal.</hi> 113. 3. and this direction agrees to the firſt direction, it is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, or it is due Weſt.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary when <hi>Moſes</hi> directed them to other places that lay Eaſt, he directed them thither by the Riſing of the Sun, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 34. 15. <hi>Deuter.</hi> 4. 41, 47. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19. 27, 34.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let <hi>Joſhua</hi> alſo ſhew his judgement about the time
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36425:38"/>
and place of Sun-ſet, and he declares his judgement by another familiar example, for he directed the <hi>Jews</hi> how to finde out the Weſt bounds of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not by the confuſed, and obſcure mark of Twilight; but firſt, by the perſpicuous mark of Sun-ſet; and ſecondly by the hindmoſt Sea, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 1. 4. he makes the hindmoſt Sea, and the going down of the Sun to be marks <hi>Synonima</hi> for the finding out of the Weſt borders of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and he doth alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this hindmoſt Sea to be the great Sea at Sun-ſet, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 23. 4. and <hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe doth call this Sea the Hindmoſt Sea, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 24. But the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> call it the Weſtern Sea. So then from the premiſes it follows, That ſeeing the places that lye due Weſt, are marked out by the perſpicuous mark of the going down of the Sun, we muſt thereby underſtand that the Sun-ſet Evening doth begin as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight; and therefore hence it follows, that thoſe that make the time of Sun-ſet, and the time of Twilight to be all one (for the begining of our Lords day) do build their opinion but on a ſandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text doth often expreſs the time of Sun-ſet by the going in of the Sun, to lodge all night (as it were in its chamber) and it is ſaid to go in as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of our Horizon. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50. 1. on the contrary, as ſoon as the body of the Sun is riſen upon our Horizon in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is ſaid <hi>to come forth</hi> as a <hi>Bridegroom out of his chamber,</hi> Pſal. 19. 5.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Experience will tell you, that the Sun is ſet as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight; or elſe if it be not ſet till the darkneſſe in the skie is more than the light in the skie, then there is no Sun-ſet at all in the North of <hi>England</hi> when the daies are at the longeſt, for experience doth teſtifie that the light is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the skie there, all the night long, except a little in the middle of the night, and yet experience doth witneſſe that the Sun doth truly ſet there every day.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Let all Aſtronomers ſhew their judgement when the Sun doth ſet, and they with one conſent do teſtifie that the Sun doth ſet as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gon out of ſight, for they deſcribe the time of Sun-ſet, and the time of the Suns riſing, by the firſt appearing of the body of the Sun in the morning, and by the body of the Sun going out of ſight in the evening, as all their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacks do teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:36425:39"/>
Sixthly, Let the Evangeliſt <hi>Marke</hi> ſhew his judgement, for he deſcribes the Evening to begin at Sun-ſet, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 32. but <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame action ſaith, It was when the Sun was ſetting, <hi>Luke</hi> 440. put this together, and it implies that the time of the beginning of the Sun-ſet Evening is as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Joſhua</hi> doth teſtifie that the Evening is come as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 10. 26, 27. and <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Darius</hi> did labour to deliver him till the going down of the Sun, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 14. But the Seventy ſay, till Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſoul that toucheth a dead creeping thing ſhall be unclean untill the Evening,</hi> Lev. 22. 6. but ſaith he, in verſ. 7. <hi>He ſhall bathe himſelf in water, and then he ſhall be clean when the Sun is gone down;</hi> from all theſe places it is evident, that the term Sun-ſet, and the term Evening, are terms convertible for the Sun-ſet Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, It is evident by this reaſon that the latter Evening doth begin as ſoon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of ſight, becauſe there is no interim between the End of the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, and the Beginning of the latter Evening; and I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chap. 2. that the firſt Evening doth end, as ſoon as ever the Sun doth leave off to make any more ſhadows upon the face of the Earth: For the whole time of the firſt Evening is deſcribed by its ſhadows looking forth towards the place of its Reſt, or by the ſtretching out of its ſhadows upon the face of the Earth, as I have expounded, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 4. and therefore it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that the latter Evening muſt begin at that inſtant time. This conſequence is ſo cleer, that none that loves plain truth can deny it.</p>
                  <p>But to prevent raſh zeal, and unadviſed haſte in feaſting upon the holy fleſh, the Hebrew Doctors adviſed to ſtay a little time after Sun-ſet, <note place="margin">They begin their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Feſtival Suppers after Sun-ſet, as ſoon as three ſtars appeared in the skie.</note> for the Sun muſt go down upon the baptized perſon before his Purification was perfected, and then he began the date of his new day, and then he was made fit to eat of the holy fleſh; yet they adviſed to ſtay a little time after Sun-ſet, namely till three ſtars appeared in the skie. <hi>Mamony</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the unclean may not eat of the Heave-offering untill their Sun be ſet, and three ſtars appear after the Sun is gone down.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 9.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I ſhewed how God ordained the time of the two
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36425:39"/>
Evenings for the effecting of two degrees of cleanneſſe; and now I ſhall in the next Section ſhew, That all the latter Evening from Sun-ſet till Mid-night, was appointed for the time of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious feaſting upon their Paſſeovers, and Peace-offerings; and that this part of the night was a true part of the former natural day.</p>

                  <p>FRom the date of the new Day to the perſon purified at the Sun-ſet Evening, we may ſee the true Reaſon that did inforce the <hi>Jewes</hi> to begin all their Ceremonial Sabbaths at that time, and of all other dayes by occaſion thereof.</p>
                  <p>But this beginning of the day was no more to be accounted for the beginning of the natural Day, than the beginning of their yeer in <hi>Niſhan</hi> was to be accounted for the firſt month by Creation; for they began their yeer in <hi>Niſhan</hi> upon the occaſion of their famous deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in that month; but from the Creation the yeer began in <hi>Tizri,</hi> which now is called the Seventh month, and this ſeventh month was afterwards made famous again by <hi>Joſhua's</hi> Conqueſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by his diviſion of the land thereupon to the nine Tribes and a half, in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth month, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 14. and in remembrance thereof they began all their yeers of Reſt, and all their Jubiles from that month. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 1, 2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 22. and likewiſe the yeers of all Servants and Leaſes began at this time, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>And after this manner they obſerved a double date according to the beginning of their double day. <note place="margin">The Jews ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved both the date of their ceremonial day, and the date of their natural day for ſeveral purpoſes. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in Lev. 23. 20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 The perſon purified began the date of his day of cleanneſſe from the Sun-ſet Evening.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They dated the time of their Religious feaſting according to the natural day till midnight after; for by the Law they were expreſly commanded to eat the fleſh of their Peace-offerings in the ſame day, in which it was ſacrificed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. now it was not poſſible for them (at ſometimes at leaſt) to eat the holy fleſh of their Paſſeovers, and of their commanded Peace-offerings, in the ſame Ceremonial day, becauſe the time of ſacrificing their Paſſeovers and Peace-offerings did many times continue until it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36425:40"/>
was night, namely till Sun-ſet; and ſo it fell out in the time of <hi>Joſias</hi> Paſſeover, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 14. Hence it follows by a neceſſary conſequence, That the command to eat the holy fleſh in the ſame day muſt be underſtood (not of the ſame Ceremonial, but) of the ſame natural day; and in caſe any of the holy fleſh had remained uneaten in the ſame day in which it was ſacrificed, it muſt be burnt, and then ſometime it muſt be all burnt, and none of it eaten, namely when it was ſacrificed at the point of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the date of their Ceremonial day had born all the ſway, then they muſt not only have finiſhed the killing of all their Sacrifices, but of all their Religious feaſts alſo, before Sun-ſet, and then our Saviour and his Apoſtles had ſinned, becauſe they kept their Religious Feaſt after Sun-ſet, namely in the night wherein he was betrayed; for though they cauſed their Paſſeover to be ſacrificed on the fourteenth day, yet they deferred the time of their feaſting till after Sun-ſet when the fifteenth day was begun, according to the date of the perſon purified. But if you will grant that our Saviour did not ſin againſt that Command of eating their Paſſeover in the ſame day, then you muſt alſo grant that the ſame fourteenth day by Creation was not ended at Sun-ſet, but continued ſtill till Mid-night after.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hence it follows, that ſeeing all Ceremonial Cuſtomes are now aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt; that Gods people ought not to Judaize, in beginning the Lords day according to the Jews Ceremonial Cuſtomes, but according to the beginning and ending of the natural day from midnight to Mid-night.</p>
                  <p>Objection 3. <hi>How could the</hi> Jewes <hi>obſerve a double date of a double day in one and the ſame naturall day without confuſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their double date of their double day was not ſtrange to them, no more than their double date of their double yeer was to them; they could ſort out ſuch things, as belonged to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yeer from the ſeventh month from the things that belonged to the beginning of the yeer in the firſt month, without any confuſion at all; ſo in like manner they could ſort out all thoſe Religious duties that belonged to their Ceremonial date, from thoſe duties that belonged to the date of the naturall day.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36425:40"/>
They knew that the Baptiſed perſon muſt begin his new day at Sun-ſet, and that all Evening Sacrifices muſt be finiſhed before Sun-ſet; and yet in reſpect of the time of Feaſting, they knew that the ſame Natural day did ſtill continue till mid-night; <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> ſaith, That the Prieſts muſt eat the Peace-offerings of the Congregation in the ſame Day, and in half the Night. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 20. Hence you may ſee, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, whom <hi>Maymony</hi> follows, did hold that the ſame day (in the caſe of Feaſting) did continue till mid-night; and indeed this time was ſufficient for the accompliſhment of all their religious Feaſts; in like ſort <hi>Solomon</hi> cals the Twilight evening of the night, the ſame day wherein the Sacrifice was ſlain, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 9. but it was not the ſame Ceremonial day, for at Sun ſet the <hi>Jews</hi> began their next day, or their morrow; but for a fuller anſwer, ſee my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in Ch. 5. to <hi>Obj.</hi> 8. &amp; 14. &amp; 17.</p>

               <p>I Have ſhewed in Cha. 2. and Sect. 2. that the natural Evening was divided into two equal parts, and now I ſhall ſhew you, that the Paſſeover was ſolemnized in both the parts of that Evening.</p>
               <p>Firſt, All the Paſſeovers, and all the Peace-offerings that were annexed thereunto, were all ſacrificed in the time of the firſt Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and it was utterly unlawful to ſacrifice any Paſſeover, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before this evening began, or after this evening was ended, which did ever begin at Mid-day, and end at Sun-ſet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All the Paſſeovers of <hi>Canaan</hi> muſt be feaſted on, with Religious ſolemnity, in the time of the latter evening.</p>
               <p>But firſt I will ſpeak of the time of Sacrificing all their Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs, and that was between the two evenings, namely, it was between the beginning of the firſt, and the beginning of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evening; this was the preciſe limited time for this work.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon Jarchi</hi> expounds the two evenings thus; From the ſixth hour (which is at Mid-day) and forwards, it is called between the two Evenings, for that the Sun declineth towards his going down, &amp;c. between the evening of the day, and the evening of the night; the evening of the Day is from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeventh hour, and the evening of the Night is when the night begins. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 3.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus; The killing of the Paſſeover is after Mid-day, and if they kill it before it is not allowable; and they kill it not but after the daily evening Sacrifice, and burning of Incenſe, and after they have trimmed the Lamps, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to kill the Paſchal Lamb, until the end of the day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
               <p>Till the end of the day was, till the Sun-ſet evening, for after Sun-ſet (ſaith <hi>Maymony)</hi> the blood of all Sacrifices became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
               <p>Hence we ſee that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors held it as a Canon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that no Paſſeover was allowable, if it were killed either before Mid-day, or after Sun-ſet; but all the time between was Gods appointed ſeaſon, <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 4.</p>
               <p>Ordinarily they began to kill their Paſſeovers at half an hour after two a Clock, but if the Paſſeover day fell out to be the <note n="*" place="margin">Some think of no other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath, but the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; but they are groſly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, for that was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sabbath but in relation to the new day to the purified perſon, but the evening of the Sabbath if ſelf began and ended as the Paſſeover evening did from mid-day to mid-night.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of the Sabbath (namely, that evening of the Sabbath which began at Mid-day) then they began to kill their Paſſeover ſonner; But (ſtill this muſt be remembred which <hi>Maymony</hi> often noteth, that) they never kild any Paſſeover till after the daily eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacrifice, and ſome other ſervices that did ever accompany it. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:36425:41"/>
But (ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors) God ſetteth no particular hour, neither for the killing of the daily evening Sacrifice, nor yet for the killing of the Paſſeover; but in general, he commanded them to be killed between the two evenings.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, That if they killed the daily evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or the Paſſeover, or the Peace-offerings, in any part of the after-noon, between the time of Mid-day and the Sun-ſet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they were allowable, and according to Gods own limited time.</p>
               <p>But becauſe God requires that all his Worſhip in all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it ſhould be done decently, and in order, both in regard of time, place, and perſons; therefore the chief Rulers of the people, thought it their duty to ſuit all the particular bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes about the Paſſeover, and the daily evening Sacrifice, to certain particular hours in the evening, ſo as all things might be done with the beſt conveniency, decency, and order, that one duty might not ſhoulder out another.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors in the <hi>Babylonian Thalmud</hi> ſay thus; the daily evening Sacrifice was killed at the eighth hour and a half, and it was offered at the ninth hour and a half (that is to ſay, at half an hour after three a Clock) But in the evening of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it was killed at the ſeventh hour and a half, and offered at the eighth hour and a half (that is to ſay, at half an hour after two a Clock) But if the evening of the Paſſeover did fall out to be upon the evening of the Sabbath, then it was killed at the ſixth hour and a half (that is to ſay, at half an hour after twelve a Clock) and it was offered at ſeven and a half. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> alſo in his <hi>Hebrew Lexicon</hi> upon the word <hi>Gnarbaiim,</hi> doth from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſhew, that if the Paſſeover evening fell upon the Sabbath evening, that then they began to kill the daily evening Sacrifice at half an hour after twelve a Clock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the manifold buſineſſes that belonged to the Sabbath, beſides the killing of their Paſſeovers; therefore that the doing of one duty might not thruſt out another, their Wiſe-men did ſet an order of time when they ſhould begin to kill the daily evening Sacrifice, which in all the days of the year was deferred to the laſt place, except on the Paſſeover evening, and then it was ever preferred to the firſt place, and when ever the Paſſeover evening

fell upon a Sabbath, then they began to kill it at half an hour after twelve a Clock, and that was as ſoon as ever they could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſhadow of the evening to be ſtretched out, or declined; and the only reaſon why they began thus early upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath evening, was, becauſe they might have ſufficient time to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all the duties of the Sabbath, and all their Paſſeovers, before Sun-ſet, for after Sun-ſet the blood of all Sacrifices became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, becauſe God had expreſly commanded all evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to be killed between the two Evenings, and becauſe they had much work to do on Paſſeover evenings, eſpecially when it fell on the Sabbath, they muſt begin to kill the daily evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at the firſt declining of the Sun, or elſe they could not kill all by Sun-ſet; for in the time of <hi>Joſiahs</hi> Paſſeover, the Paſſeovers, and Peace-offerings were ſo many, that the Prieſts could not finiſh all till night, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 14.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>You have often cited the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors, as if they did all agree in one, That the Natural evening did begin at Mid-day; but Mr.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Shepheard <hi>in his third Part on the Sabbath,</hi> Theſis 36. <hi>doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors teſtimonies are of little worth, becauſe they do often contradict one another about the beginning of the evening, for though ſome of them do ſay, that the evening doth begin at Mid-day, yet they are over-whelmed with croſſe teſtimonies, from the moſt of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who begin it ſome about one, ſome about two a Clock in the afternoon; and</hi> Joſephus, <hi>who is one of moſt credit, in his Writings tels us, That they began their firſt evening about three a Clock in the afternoon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I would Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi> had cited the particular places, where the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do croſſe one another about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Evening, for then the particular places ſhould have been examined, by the help of ſuch as are expert in their Writings. I grant that ſome of them do ſpeak of the beginning of the Evening at one hour, and ſome at another, and yet all this without any contradiction; for in regard of ſeverall duties that muſt be tranſ-acted at ſeveral hours in the evening, they had juſt occaſion to ſpeak of the beginning of the evening at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours, in relation to the ſaid ſeveral duties that muſt begin at ſeveral hours of the ſaid evening, as I noted it in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. at ſeventhly, and as I have noted it immediately afore from the <hi>Babylonian Thalmud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if it do appear true, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth preciſely begin the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36425:42"/>
evening at three a clock and not in relation to ſome ſpecial duty, then I grant that ſuch a teſtimony is worthy of due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but I beleeve that <hi>Joſephus</hi> is ſome way or other miſtaken, for the <hi>Thalmud</hi> called <hi>Jeruſalemie,</hi> which was finiſhed ſince <hi>Joſephus</hi>

Sun-ſet, ſo that they might have killed all their Paſſeovers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after Mid-day, or they might have ſtaid till neer Sun-ſet, provided it were done before Sun-ſet; but they could not kill all their Paſſeovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> at an inſtant, at the time of Sun-ſet, as they might have done in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In <hi>Egypt</hi> every firſt-born of every family might kil the Paſchal Lamb.</item>
                  <item>2 They might kill it in their own private houſe.</item>
                  <item>3 They might ſprinkle the blood of it upon their door-poſts without going to the Altar.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But in <hi>Canaan</hi> they muſt have a longer ſpace of time to do theſe works in; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The firſt-born of every family might not kill their Sacrifices in <hi>Canaan,</hi> but in their place the Lord choſe the Tribe of <hi>Levy.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 22. <hi>Num.</hi> 3. 12. 41, 45. <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 5. and the number of this Tribe, I conceive, were not ſo many as the firſt-born were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and therefore could not kill all in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Levites had many more buſineſſes to do about the Paſſeover in <hi>Canaan</hi> than in <hi>Egypt</hi> (eſpecially if the Paſſeover fell out upon a Sabbath) for ſaith <hi>Maymony, They kill not the Paſſeover,</hi> but after the daily evening ſacrifice, &amp; after the burning of incenſe, and after they have trimmed the Lamps, and beſides in <hi>Canaan</hi> they uſed to kill many Peace-offerings therewith: all this would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more time than the firſt-born of every family needed in <hi>Egypt</hi> for the killing of the Paſchal Lamb onely, without theſe other ſervices.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They might not kill their Paſſeovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> in private houſes as they did in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but all their Paſſeovers muſt be brought to be ſacrificed at the place the Lord ſhould chooſe to place his braſen Altar at, which at firſt was at <hi>Shilo,</hi> and at laſt in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 5, 6. with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 5, 11, 12, 14, 18. and in reſpect hereof the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, <hi>He that killeth holy things out of the Court of the Sanctuary, if he do it preſumptuouſly, he is guilty of cutting off.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 2, 5, 8, 9. nay though a Prieſt did kill a Sacrifice in the Temple it ſelf, yet it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unlawful, if the blood thereof were but carried out of the Temple before it was ſprinkled upon the Altar; for thus ſaith <hi>Maymony, The blood of the holy things that goeth out of the Court becommeth unlawful for Sacrifice, yea though they bring it in again, and ſprinkle it upon</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:36425:43"/>
                  <hi>the Altar, yet it is not acceptable.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Jewes</hi> had thought it as lawful for them to kill the Paſſeover in a private houſe (ever ſince the deſtruction of the Temple) as they did at the firſt Paſſeover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they would not have omitted to ſacrifice the Paſſeover now in all the places of their diſperſion; but ever ſince their Temple was deſtroyed, they have been without the Paſſeover, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all other Sacrifices for the ſpace of ſixteen hundred yeers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; And thus ſpeaketh Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: He that ſhall kill the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> ever ſince Jeſus Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Canaan,</hi> in a private houſe, had been held an open enemy to the truth of God. And <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, <hi>That now they can have no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, becauſe they can have no Temple, neither can they kill the Paſchal Lamb, but inſtead thereof they onely uſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened bread with bitter herbs, and wine in their private houſes.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8. Hence it follows, that ſeeing all the Paſſeovers muſt be brought to one publick place, that it would require a longer ſpace to kill one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another than they needed in <hi>Egypt</hi> where every houſe might kill their Lamb at one hour.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In reſpect of the place of ſprinkling, it muſt be all <note place="margin">All Paſſeovers were ſacrifices therefore the blood of them all muſt be ſprinkled on the Lords Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</note> done at one Altar, and therefore it would require a longer time than they needed in <hi>Egypt;</hi> for there every firſt-born might ſprinkle the blood upon the door-poſts of his own private houſe at one hour together, but the ſprinkling of the blood of all the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs in <hi>Canaan</hi> could not be done in ſo ſhort a ſpace, becauſe all muſt be done at one Altar one after another, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 5. for all Paſſeovers were Sacrifices, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 25. and no Levites, but the Prieſts onely, muſt ſprinkle the blood of all Paſſeovers, and of all Sacrifices, upon the Lords Altar, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 16. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 11.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Lord did appropriate the blood of all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices <note place="margin">Blood was the Lords peculiar portion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the Jews to eat blood, and alſo ſome ſorts of fat.</note> to himſelf as his peculiar right to make attonement for mens ſouls, therefore in that reſpect he did ſtraitly prohibit the <hi>Jews</hi> that they ſhould not eat any blood. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 2, 14, 26, 27. <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 6, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 27. and for this very reaſon alſo he forbad them to eat ſuch parts of the fat as he did, challenge for his own Altar; and in this reſpect alſo he did challenge the fat of their Paſſeovers as much as of any other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; all which he commanded to be burned upon his Altar
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36425:44"/>
for a ſweet ſavour of Attonement, as the former Scriptures do teſtifie.</p>
               <p>Now from the conſideration of theſe four Circumſtances, it follows, that all the Paſſeovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> could not be ſacrificed in ſo ſhort a time as about the time of Sun-ſet; and therefore this phraſe about the going down of the Sun, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. muſt not be underſtood of the very time of Sun-ſet, but of the whole time of the Suns declining from Mid-day till it went down out of that Horizon.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>Though the</hi> Jews <hi>might not kill their Paſſeovers in</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan <hi>in their private houſes as they did in</hi> Egypt, <hi>yet they might kill them at more Altars than one; for the Lord was pleaſed to allow ſeveral Altars for Sacrifices in ſeveral places; and by this means all the Paſſeovers in</hi> Canaan <hi>might be killed, and the blood ſprinkled juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of Sun-ſet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant that the Lord was pleaſed to permit the uſe of many Altars and High-places in the dayes of <hi>Samuel;</hi> for there <note place="margin">The Lord permitted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny private Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars in the dayes of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> but he allowed but one publick Altar for the general Feaſts of the twelve Tribes, and for the Paſſeover day, and for the daily Morning and Evening Sacrifice.</note> was an Altar at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 15. Secondly, There was an Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 3. 5. Thirdly, At <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>Judg.</hi> 21. 1, 4. Fourthly, At <hi>Ramah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 17. and there were ſeveral Altars alſo in the dayes of <hi>Elijah;</hi> for he complained to God that <hi>Jezabel</hi> had broken down his Altars; But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, no Paſſeover might be killed at any of theſe Altars; for the Paſſeover in <hi>Canaan</hi> was commanded to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as a general Feaſt; but theſe Altars were private Altars onely, raiſed by Gods allowance by ſome particular perſon upon ſome ſpecial occaſion, and were after permited to be uſed by ſome adjacent Tribe or perſons, and in that reſpect theſe Altars were made but of earth or ſtone that was unhewn: But the Altar that God commanded to be erected as the general publick Altar of all the twelve Tribes, was made of braſſe, at the coſt of the twelve Tribes, and this was placed at firſt in the Lords Tabernacle in the Wilderneſſe; afterwards this Tabernacle, together with the brazen Altar, was placed by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in <hi>Shilo</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim, Joſh.</hi> 18. 1. and there it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for the place of the general Aſſembly of all the twelve Tribes for three hundred and fifty yeers, till the death of <hi>Eli;</hi> but after the Philiſtims had taken the Lords Aark, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 10, 11. and ſlain the moſt valiant men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in that battel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 9.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36425:44"/>
God was wroth with <hi>Shilo,</hi> and forſook it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 60. for by that great deſtruction of all the valiant men of <hi>Ephraim, Shilo</hi> was now become too weak a place to guard the holy Tabernacle, and the holy Altar, and therefore it was by the Lords advice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Gibbeon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. which was a Royal City, and a place of great ſtrength, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 2. lying in the Tribe of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and it was allotted to the Prieſts, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21. 17. and the <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites</hi> the ancient inhabitants were given to the Prieſts to cut wood, and draw water for the houſe of the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. 21, 23. 27. and afterwards in <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes they were called <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinims,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
               <p>And from henceforth this place was called the chief High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, becauſe the Lords Tabernacle, and the Lords Altar were placed therein, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 4. and in that reſpect <hi>David</hi> took care to provide a competent number of Prieſts to attend it: But afterwards when <hi>David</hi> had recovered the Ark from the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims, and had brought it into the Tent that he had provided for it in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> He divided the Prieſts into two parts, and he appointed <hi>Aſaph</hi> and his brethren to miniſter before the Lord at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 37. and he appointed <hi>Zadoc</hi> and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to miniſter at the Lords brazen Altar at his Tabernacle at <hi>Gibbeon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 39.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Solomon</hi> had finiſhed his Temple, he cauſed the Prieſts firſt of all to bring the Ark of the Lord into its place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for it in the Temple, and then he cauſed the Prieſts to bring up the Tabernacle of the Congregation, with all the holy veſſels into the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 4. and after this manner the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and choſe the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> and Mount <hi>Sion</hi> (of <hi>Benjamin)</hi> which he loved. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 68.</p>
               <p>This brazen Altar was made and conſecrated to be the publick Altar for the General Aſſemblies of all the twelve Tribes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. 1. and in that reſpect where ever this Altar was placed, there was the chief High place, untill <hi>Solomon</hi> had made another brazen Alrar in the place of it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>At this Altar was offered the daily Morning and Evening ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for all the twelve Tribes, and the Paſſeovers of all the twelve Tribes, and they might not be offered in any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer private High places: The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, They ſacrificed not the Paſſeover in a private High-place (no not in the time
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36425:45"/>
when private High-places were permitted) and whoſoever offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Paſſeover in a private High-place is beaten; for it is ſaid in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Thou mayeſt not ſacrifice the Paſſeover in any of thy gates:</hi> we have been taught, that this is a prohibition to kil it in a private High-place, although it be in the time when private High-places were permitted. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 5. and ſuch a private Altar as this was at <hi>Bethlem</hi> where <hi>Iſhai</hi> had a yeerly Sacrifice, and Feaſt for all the family, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 26. and ſuch a private Altar as this did <hi>Saul</hi> build with ſtone, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 35. And of theſe Altars it is ſaid, that when <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> deſtroyed the Idolatrous High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places, that they did not deſtroy theſe High-places, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 43. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 17.</p>
               <p>Now from all the premiſes it follows, That ſeeing they might not kill their Paſſeovers at ſeveral High-places, nor ſprinkle the blood on ſeveral Altars, but at the general High-place, and at the general Altar onely, That all the Paſſeovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> could not be killed, and their blood ſprinkled in ſo ſhort a time as about the time of Sun-ſet, and therefore that Command in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. at the going down of the Sun, muſt not be underſtood of the Sun-ſet Evening, but it muſt be underſtood of the whole time of the Suns declining from Mid-day till Sun-ſet, juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time of the two Evenings in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
               <p>2. Let me adde another Reaſon why the going down of the Sun <note place="margin">The Paſſeover day was no Sabbath, it was but a half holy-day.</note> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. cannot be underſtood of the time of Sun-ſet; namely becauſe the fifteenth day according to the date of the perſon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, began at Sun-ſet; but no Paſſeover might be ſacrificed after the fifteenth day was come, but all are commanded to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed in the fourteenth day at Even.</p>
               <p>3. No other part of the fourteenth day was commanded to be kept holy, but the Evening of the fourteenth day<hi>:</hi> The <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy,</hi> and the <hi>Babylonian Thalmuds</hi> ſay, that men might follow their work and labour all the firſt half of the day; but at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day (ſay they) they muſt leave off, and begin their Reſt. <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>It is not unlawful to do work in the fourteenth of</hi> Niſhan, <hi>ſave from the midſt of the day, and ſo forwards; But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth work in the Paſſeover Evening after Mid-day, he is to be ſcourged or excommunicated, becauſe the Evening of the fourteenth day of</hi> Niſhan, <hi>is not like to the Evening of other Feſtival dayes, becauſe in it is the Sacrifice, and the Feaſt.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:36425:45"/>
From theſe Teſtimonies of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe four <hi>Thalmudical</hi> Tenents.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the fourteenth of <hi>Niſhan</hi> was not a full holy-day (as ſome do unadviſedly affirm) it was no more but a half-holiday, namely the full Evening onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved two ſorts of Evenings to every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; one before the Sabbath for the date of the perſon purified; and another from Mid-day, and ſo forwards; for the Evening of the 14. of <hi>Niſhan</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maymony)</hi> is not like unto the evening of other Feſtival dayes, becauſe in it is the Sacrifice, and the Feaſt; But the Evening of other Feſtival dayes, meaning the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had no ſacrifice; but yet the Mid-day Evening of every Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival Sabbath was as holy as the Paſſeover Evening, and had Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and feaſting belonging to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That the Evening of the fourteenth day was the time of ſacrificing all their Paſſeovers.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That from the time of Sun-ſet till Mid-night was the time of Feaſting on the Paſſeover, and that it belonged to the Evening of the fourteenth day.</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded them to kill all their Paſſeovers in the Evening about the going down of the Sun, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 6. he did not mean it of the Sun-ſet Evening, but of the Mid-day Evening, for then the Sun doth firſt begin to go down, or decline.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>If the buſineſſe about the Paſſeover was ſo reſtrained as you ſay it was,</hi>

                  <hi>Then I do not ſee how they could ſacrifice all the Paſſeovers of</hi> Canaan <hi>between the two Evenings from Mid-day to Sun-ſet; for there could not be leſſe than a hundred thouſand Paſſeovers and Peace-offerings, when all the twelve Tribes met together, though you do allow twelve or thirteen perſons to each Paſſeover.</hi>

               <p>And this was no impoſſible, but a fecible thing, if all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of quick diſpatch be rightly weighed.</p>
               <p n="1">1 There was a competent number of Prieſts &amp; Levites that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon this ſervice; for though at firſt the number of the Prieſts and Levites in the Wilderneſſe from thirty yeers old to fifty, was but eight thouſand five hundred and eighty, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 48. yet at length they were ſo multiplied, that in the dayes of <hi>David</hi> they were eight and thirty thouſand men, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 3. So many hands therefore would make but light work of a hundred thouſand Paſſeovers in the time of the firſt Evening from Mid-day till Sun-ſet.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The place where they killed all their Paſſeovers and Peace-offerings was not ſtrait, but conveniently ſpacious; for theſe kind of ſacrifices might be killed in any part of the Court of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe they were numbred among their lighter holy things. But the moſt holy things, ſuch as the Burnt-offering, Sin-offering and Treſpaſſe-offerings were, theſe muſt be killed neerer to the Altar than the Paſſeovers and Peace-offerings were, namely upon the ground cloſe by the North-ſide of the Altar, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 2. But the light holy things, ſuch as the Paſſeover, and Peace-offerings were, them they killed, and received the blood in Bowls, in any part of the Court-yard, ſaith <hi>Manymony.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Though no Levite might ſprinkle the blood of any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon the Altar, yet for the quicker diſpatch of many Sacrifices <note place="margin">No I evites, none but Prieſts onely muſt ſprinkle the blood of the ſacrifice upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</note> they might kill and receive the blood in Bowls, and ſo bring it to the Prieſts that ſtood ready at the foot of the Altar to receive it, and to ſprinkle it upon the Altar; for no Levite, but Prieſts onely might ſprinkle the blood upon the Altar; for the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the blood was of the Eſſence of the ſacrifice as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors do collect. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 5. 6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 45. The Levites might kill, and flay, and receive the blood in Bowls, and bring it to the Prieſts that ſtood ready to receive it at their hands at the foot of the Altar, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 34, 35. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30. 17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 11. and this occaſioned the Prieſt to make the more quick diſpatch; and eſpecially conſidering the Prieſts and Levites were ſo dextrous in their office they might kill a hundred thouſand
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36425:46"/>
Paſſeovers and Peace-offerings between Mid-day and Sun-ſet; and there is a cleer example that all this was done in the time and manner aforeſaid in the eighteenth yeer of <hi>Joſias,</hi> and yet there never was the like Paſſeover kept in <hi>Iſrael</hi> (namely not when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was joyned with <hi>Judah,</hi> there was not the like Paſſeover, and yet doubtleſſe, there were as many Paſchal Lambs, but never the like multitude of Peace-offerings that were added to the Paſſeover, and in that reſpect they were called the Paſſeover, as they are in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. 4.) from the dayes of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet unto that day, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 35. 18.</p>
               <p>Object. 5. <hi>How could ſo many thouſand Paſſeovers be roſted in one Temple, and how could ſo many thouſand people ſit there in companies to feaſt on their Paſſeovers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As for the great buſineſs of Roſting ſo many Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs, It was not tyed precizely to the Temple as the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing was: for though there were many Paſſeovers Roſted in the Temple, as there were in the dayes of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 13. yet that buſineſs might alſo be tranſmitted to any houſe in the Holy City, as I ſhewed a little before, and as the example of our Saviour, and his Apoſtles doth teſtifie; for our Saviour was at <hi>Bethany,</hi> when he ſent two of his Diſciples to make ready the Paſſeover; 1 By carrying their Lamb to the Temple to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and thence to a private houſe in the holy City to be ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; and as ſoon as the Sun-ſet Evening was come, our Saviour came to the place appointed, and as ſoon as the hour for feaſting was come, our Saviour ſat down with the twelve, and he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in feaſting with the twelve firſt on the Paſſeover, and then 2 on their Peace-offerings, with his prayers and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">It was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for above twenty perſons to joyn together for one Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</note> the full time of the latter Evening from Sun-ſet till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 18, 20. By this example, we ſee that thirteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may conveniently joyn together at one Paſſeover, and the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Doctors ſay, That twenty may make their account for one Lamb, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 4. but not above twenty.</p>
               <p>By this means we may perceive that all the Paſsovers in <hi>Canaan</hi> might well be diſpatched in the Evening of the fourteenth day, in the firſt Evening they might be all ſacrificed, and in the ſecond Evening they might all be feaſted on with Religious ſolemnity, without any doubt to the contrary.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was in the ſtrength or in the body of the day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 41. namely it was about Mid-day. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, That as God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> at Mid-day, ſo he ſlew the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> at Mid-night. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not flye out of <hi>Egypt</hi> as perſons frighted, either in the Sun-ſet Evening, or in the Twilight, as it were through ſtealth, or through fear, as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> did out of <hi>Jeruſalem, Ezek.</hi> 12. but they went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a high hand, in the fight of all the Egyptians, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. 3. or they went out in the ſtrength or in the body of the day, for at Mid-day the Sun is in its greateſt ſtrength, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 16. but after the Mid-day is paſt, namely as ſoon as the Sun is declined but a little towards the Weſt, or towards the place of Sun-ſet, then the day is ſaid to grow weak, ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jud.</hi> 19. 19. for then the Sun hath loſt much of its ſtrength which it had at Mid-day, and then the day may be ſaid to be ſpent, or to be bowed down, or declined; all theſe phraſes are uſed, and may be compared together, ſee <hi>Judg.</hi> 19. 19. with <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 35. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 19. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 24 29.</p>
               <p>Object. 7. <hi>Perhaps this phraſe,</hi> At the ſeaſon thou cameſt out of <hi>Egypt, doth not mean the time of the day, but the time of the yeer when they departed, and according to that time of the yeer</hi> Moſes <hi>doth command them to kill all their Paſsovers.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This day which is called the Firſt day of Unleavened bread, cannot be rightly underſtood without the knowledge of the Jewiſh ancient Cuſtomes, which are now for our informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion recorded in the <hi>Thalmuds;</hi> and becauſe this, and many other phraſes in the New Teſtament are recorded in the <hi>Thalmuds,</hi> we may well ſay, That the New Teſtament doth often Thalmudize, becauſe it uſeth many termes that are no where elſe to be found but in the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, and in the <hi>Thalmuds</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>Now for Anſwer in a more ſpecial manner, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do comprehend under the general term of the Feaſt of Unleavened-bread (and more eſpecially under the firſt day of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened-bread) the Feaſt of the Paſchal Lamb; for though they are two diſtinct Feaſts, yet they are alſo ſo interwoven together, that they may well be called the one for the other; for though the Paſchal Lamb was alwayes ſacrificed on the 14. day between the two Evenings, yet the time of feaſting on that holy fleſh, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sun-ſet, which was after the fifteenth day (called the firſt of Unleavened-bread) was begun, according to the date of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon purified; and yet the Feaſt of this Evening was no part of the Feaſt of Unleavened-bread, for the ſacrifices of that day were not yet killed; but this Feaſt was the proper Feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over belonging to the fourteenth day, and with the Paſſeover alſo they might not eat any Leavened (but Unleavened) bread, and in this reſpect <hi>Maymony</hi> doth call the Feaſt of the Paſchal Lamb, the Feaſt of Unleavened-bread, and ſometimes he calls the ſeven days of the proper Feaſt of Unleavened bread by the name of the Paſſeover, interchangeably confounding the termes. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 7. and in this ſenſe alſo <hi>Targum Jonathan</hi> calls the ſecond day of Unleavened-bread, the day that followed the firſt good day of Paſſeover.

Hence you ſee, that he cals the firſt day of Unleavened-bread, The firſt good day of the Paſſeover, and ſo interchangeably they call the proper feaſt of the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> the firſt day of Unleavened-bread; and from this uſual dialect among them the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Diſciples came to Jeſus Chriſt on the firſt day of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened bread,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But yet ſecondly, The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do ſometimes diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the proper Feaſt of the <hi>Paſcha</hi> from the firſt day of the proper Feaſt of Unleavened bread; <hi>Charkumi</hi> calleth the Evening of the firſt good day, and that Night, the Paſſeover; But (ſaith he) the reſidue of the Feaſt from the firſt Night, and ſo forwards, is called the Feaſt of Unleavened-cakes; See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 6. and according to this diſtinction ſpeaketh the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark, Mar.</hi> 14. 1. after two dayes followed the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> and the Unleavened-bread; and this diſtinction doth alſo agree with the twofold Command in <hi>Moſes,</hi> In the fourteenth day of the firſt month is the Paſſeover; And in the fifteenth day (which begins at Sun-ſet) is the Feaſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Object. 9. <hi>Mr.</hi> Weams <hi>and others, do affirm, That the</hi> Jews <hi>ate not the Paſsover on the fourteenth of</hi> Niſhan <hi>as Chriſt did, but transferred it to the fifteenth day, and to the beginning of the ſixteenth day; and he gives this reaſon for it, becauſe the next day (after Chriſt had eaten his Paſsover) is called the Preparation-day to the Jewiſh Paſsover,</hi> Joh. 18. 28. Joh. 19. 14. <hi>Hence he infers, that the</hi> Jews <hi>transferred the eating of the Paſsover till the next day after Chriſt had eaten his.

               <p>Secondly, The Evangeliſt <hi>Mark</hi> doth teſtifie on the <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half againſt all men, that they kept the Paſcha in the very ſelf-ſame day that our Lord and his Diſciples did, for <hi>Mark</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it thus; <hi>In the firſt day of unleavened Bread, [when they Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed the Paſſeover] his Diſciples ſaid unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou maiſt eat the Paſſeover?</hi> Mark 14. 12. this term <hi>[when they]</hi> namely when the <hi>Iews</hi> in general ſacrificed the Paſſeover, then his Diſciples ſaid unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou (as wel as they) maiſt eat the Paſſeover on the ſelf-ſame day as the <hi>Iews</hi> in general did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt himſelf doth bear witneſſe, that the <hi>Iews</hi> in general did keep the Paſcha in the very ſelf-ſame day that hee did; <hi>Yee know</hi> (ſaid Chriſt unto his Diſciples) <hi>that after two days the Paſcha is kept,</hi> Mat. 26. 2. he ſaith, You know it, that the Paſcha is then kept; it was a known cuſtom among them, that after two days the Paſcha is kept, namely generally of all the <hi>Iows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Hebrew Doctors do proteſt, that they puniſh him that paſſeth the fourteenth day for the killing of the Paſcha; <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, it is an expreſſe Commandment to kill the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha in the month <hi>Niſhan,</hi> in the 14th. day, and (ſaith he) he that breaketh this Commandment and killeth it not in the 14th. day, being not defiled, nor in a far journey, is guilty of being rooted out (or cut off) thus the <hi>Iews</hi> proteſt againſt our ſlander.

               <p>Fifthly, This our groſſe miſtake of the <hi>Iews</hi> practiſe doth ariſe from our miſtake of the meaning of the word Paſſeover, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 28. he ſaith thus; <hi>The Iews went not into</hi> Pilate: <hi>common Hall leſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Paſſeover;</hi> and in ch. 19. 14. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>It was the preparation of the Paſſeover, and about the ſixth hour.</hi> Hence ſome that are not wel acquainted with the <hi>Iews</hi> cuſtoms, which are now recorded in their <hi>Thalmuds,</hi> as the learned do obſerve, have collected this inference, that the <hi>Iews</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

the Paſſeover from the evening of the fourteenth day, to the evening of the fifteenth day, and alſo to the ſixteenth day; but indeed in this term Paſſeover <hi>Iohn</hi> doth <hi>Thalmudize,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without the help of the Hebrew Doctors it is not eaſie to ſpel <hi>Iohns</hi> meaning; they apply the term Paſſeover not only to the proper Feaſt of the Paſcha, but (as I noted in my anſwer to the former objection) they uſe it as a general term for the whole Feaſt of unleavened Bread, and in that reſpect they count all the days of it as if they were the days of the Paſſeover; but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially they did account the firſt day of unleavened Bread to be a Paſſeover day, becauſe they did then feaſt on the Peace-offerings belonging to the Paſſeover, for they ſacrificed with the Paſchal Lamb on the fourteenth day, certain Peace-offerings of Sheep or Oxen, and theſe voluntary Peace-offerings they called the Paſſeover, becauſe they were ſacrificed together with the Paſchal Lamb on the fourteenth day; and by the Law they might bee eaten for the ſpace of two days and one night, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 16. now the <hi>Iews</hi> had eaten the Paſchal Lamb the night before, but they had not as yet endedtheir feaſting on theſe Peace-offerings, which <hi>Iohn</hi> calls the Paſſeover; the term Paſſeover in this laſt ſenſe is not underſtood of many; but Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> have given ſpecial notice of the word Paſſeover in this ſenſe, and that the Hebrew Doctors had grounded their common uſe of it on the Law, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. 4. and Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> cites <hi>Solomon Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> ſpeaking thus in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. If many belong to one Paſſeover, then they adde to it <hi>Chagiga,</hi> Oxen, for the Holy-day feaſt, and ſaith <hi>Jarchy</hi> (preſently after) the proper ſenſe of the Scripture is, that the fleſh of the Chagigah-Paſſeover, which thou doſt ſacrifice in the evening with the Lamb-Paſſeover, ſhal be eaten in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, and in the fifteenth day (take notice by the way that he makes no mention of the ſixteenth day, as Mr. <hi>Weames</hi> doth moſt falſly.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maymony</hi> alſo ſaith, When they offered the Paſſeover in the firſt Month, they offered it with the Peace-offerings of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, Oxen, or Flock-beaſts, great or ſmall, Male or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; but they offered not the <hi>Chagigah</hi> if the Lamb ſufficed the company, and ſo it was voluntary and not forced by (any affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative) Commandment, and it was eaten two days and one night (and not in the ſecond night, as M. <hi>Weames</hi> doth miſtaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:36425:49"/>
In theſe words <hi>Maymony</hi> doth tell us, that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpake from the depth of <hi>Thalmudique</hi> knowledge, and in this ſenſe alſo doth Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> explain the equivocation of the word Paſſeover from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2, 4. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> ſaith it was morning and they went not into <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe Peace-offerings are called the Paſſeover by the Lawonce, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. and they are alſo clearly comprehended under the term Paſſeover in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 11. but they are moſt uſually called the Paſſeover in the Writings of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, and from their cuſtom <hi>John</hi> doth uſe the word Paſſeover in their ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> ſaith it was morning, and it was the preparation of the Paſſeover, and about the ſixth hour, which ſixth hour, according to their account by their great hours, began at our ten a Clock, and ended with our twelve a Clock, and this time was called the <hi>Jews</hi> preparation in order to their Paſſeover Dinner, and in that reſpect they were afraid to come into <hi>Pilates</hi> Common Hall leſt they ſhould be defiled, and ſo might be made unfit to eat the Paſſeovers Peace-offerings at Dinner time.</p>
               <p>Object. 10. <hi>You ſay that by the allowance of the Law the</hi> Jews <hi>might feaſt on the Peace-offerings that were offered with the Paſſeover, for two days and one night, namely, till the next day at Sun-ſet, but not after Sun-ſet; but</hi> John <hi>ſpeaks of another preparation to the Sabbath, his words in</hi> chap. 19. 31. <hi>run thus; The</hi> Jews <hi>then becauſe it was the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the bodies ſhould not remain upon the Croſſe (for that Sabbath was a high day) beſought</hi> Pilate <hi>that their leggs might be broken, and that they might be taken down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This preparation is indeed a differing preparation from the former, the former was their fore-noon preparation to their Paſſeover Dinner, but this preparation was nigh unto Sun-ſet, and ſo conſequently it approached apace unto that feſtival Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that did properly belong unto the Feaſt of unleavened Bread, and in that reſpect they beſought <hi>Pilate</hi> that their leggs might be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36425:50"/>
broken, and that they might be taken down, leſt their cruelty, in ſuffering them to hang longer on the Tree, ſhould be a blot to their joyful Feaſt, for this day was the firſt of unleavened Bread, which was the firſt and the chief of all their High Sabbaths: Now as ſoon as the chief Prieſts had made this requeſt to <hi>Pilate, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> did wiſely eſpy the advantage of time, and then he alſo went boldly unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> requeſting that he might have the Body of Jeſus in his own power to bury it. The time when this was done was when the Evening was come, as two Evangeliſts do witneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 15. 42. and ſo <hi>Tindall</hi> in his Bible doth tranſlate and expound <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 42. thus, <hi>when night was come,</hi> becauſe it was the evening that goeth before the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>This preparation therefore in <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 31. muſt needs be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their ſolemn Feſtival Supper, which did properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this High Sabbath, as <hi>John</hi> doth call it.</p>
               <p>Before Dinner the <hi>Jews</hi> were careful leſt they ſhould be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by going into <hi>Pilates</hi> Judgement Hall, and ſo ſhould have been hindred from their Feſtival Dinner, and now alſo at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet they take the like care to avoyd cruelty, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If this Sabbath ſpoken of had been the weekly Sabbath, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day, then though they had been defiled they might have reſorted to their Synagogues, for there the clean and the unclean might meet together every Sabbath, or ſeventh Day, as I have obſerved in Chap. 4. but in caſe they had been defiled by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident whatſoever at Sun-ſet, they could not have eaten of their feſtival Sabbath-ſupper, for all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were admoniſhed to be clean at every ſolemn Feaſt, ſaith <hi>Maymony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. 11. <hi>Why doth</hi> John <hi>call the firſt day of the Feaſt of unleavened Bread a high Sabbath?</hi> Joh. 19. 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> All the ſeven ſolemn Feſtival Sabbaths in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 7. are called High Feaſts by the <hi>Geneva,</hi> in <hi>Eze.</hi> 45. 17. But ſecondly, this firſt day of the Feaſt of unleavened Bread was the very firſt of all thoſe ſeven Sabbaths, it was the day in which the Lord brought them out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> with a high hand, and therefore the Lord did in a ſpecial manner charge them to remember this day for ever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 3. this Day and the weekly Sabbath have the word <hi>remember</hi> prefixed before them more than any other Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and in this regard the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors in <hi>Deuteroproton,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:36425:50"/>
and in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> do call Paſcha day a great Sabbath, but they do not give this high title to the proper Paſſeover day, for that was no Sabbath, it was but half Holy-day, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not reckon it into the number of the Feſtival Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. but they mean it of the firſt day of the Feaſt of unleavened Bread, this day they called a great Sabbath, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha Day, becauſe in it they did feſtivally eat the remainder of their Peace-offerings, which they had offered with the Lamb-Paſſeover on the fourteenth day.</p>
               <p>But though they held this day to be a great Feſtival Sabbath, and ſhewed great reverence to it now in their requeſt to <hi>Pilate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was their preparation time to their Feſtival Supper, yet in the morning they held it lawful to judge Cauſes of Life and Death, as we may ſee they did in our Saviours caſe, and after Sun-ſet they held it lawful not only to bury, but alſo to imbalm the Dead, as the godly perſons did to our Saviour. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 56. but they did not hold any of this work lawful to be done on their weekly Sabbath, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 56.</p>
               <p>Obj. 12. <hi>Why doth</hi> John <hi>uſe the term Sabbath twice over in</hi> John 19. 31. <hi>doth he ſpeak but of one kinde, or of two ſorts of Sabbaths?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ. John</hi> ſpeaks but of one high Feſtival Sabbath only, now it was their immediate preparation to their high Feſtival Sabbath-Supper, and therefore having ſatisfied their malice on Chriſt, they beſought <hi>Pilate</hi> that their leggs might be broken, and that they might be taken down, for that Sabbath was a high Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. I grant alſo that the weekly Sabbath was now begun, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the date of the perſon purified, but not the ſeventh Day it ſelf, for this high Feſtival Sabbath was now in its full force, and in its ſolemn Feaſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The time of Chriſts Burial is noted by <hi>Luke</hi> to bee <note place="margin">The time of Chriſts burial was at Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</note> when the ſaid Feſtival Sabbath did begin to lighten, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 54 ſo doth Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weames</hi> read it, and ſo doth the <hi>Syriac</hi> read it; in this phraſe the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> doth plainly Thalmudize, his words run thus; That day was the preparation, and the Sabbath began to lighten; two things are obſervable; 1. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith this day was the preparation, namely to their feſtival Supper. 2. He deſcribes the exact time when Chriſt was inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the heart of the earth; it was when this High Sabbath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to lighten, namely, in the firſt place with the Evening Star,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36425:51"/>
and that was a perſpicuous mark of the near time of their Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Supper, but they did not begin their Feſtival Supper till three Stars appeared, as I have noted in chap. 4. and <hi>Luke</hi> doth relate to this cuſtom of theirs, in ſhewing that the time of Chriſts Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial was, when the Sabbath began to lighten; but I beleeve the chief Prieſts did deferre the time of their feaſting now ſomewhat longer than at other times, becauſe they had ſome buſineſſe to do with <hi>Pilate</hi> before they could intend their Feſtival Supper, for they went to <hi>Pilate</hi> to intreat him, that the Sepulchre might be made ſure until the third day, becauſe this Deceiver ſaid, that he would riſe again the third day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 62, 63. This requeſt of theirs no doubt did occaſion their delay to begin their High Sabbath Supper till more than three Stars appeared in the Skie this night.</p>
               <p>Obj. 12. <hi>You ſay the Prieſts went to</hi> Pilate <hi>to intreat him to make ſure the Sepulchre before they kept their Feſtival Supper; but it is out of doubt (I think) that they did not go to</hi> Pilate <hi>till the next morning, for</hi> Matthew <hi>calls the time of their going to</hi> Pilate <hi>the next day that followed their preparation,</hi> Mat. 27. 62.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Ignorance of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Cuſtoms makes many miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the next day began at Sun-ſet, as I have ſufficiently explained the matter in Chap. 4. Sect. 2. and this day followed their Preparation to their Feſtival Supper, for their preparation in the after-noon was either by waſhing away of ſome light defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or elſe it was their preparation of holy fleſh by offering ſacrifices, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Matthews</hi> meaning lyes fair and round thus; The next day (after their preparation) which began at the Sun-ſet evening, they aſſembled unto <hi>Pilate</hi> to make the fore-ſaid requeſt. Hence note, that they did not go to <hi>Pilate</hi> to make this requeſt till the next day, namely, not till after Sun-ſet, and then alſo they had commiſſion to make him ſure, by appointing ſuch a Watch; and all this they did after it was Star-light.</p>
               <p>Their Satanical policy would not ſuffer them to ſtay ſo long as until the next morning, for then <hi>Pilate</hi> would have ſaid to them, Why did you neglect to ſet a Watch about his Sepulcre over night, as ſoon as he was buried, for if his Diſciples had had any minde to ſteale him away they would have done it in the firſt part of the night? and doubtleſſe when the Souldiers came to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36425:51"/>
the chief Prieſts to tell them what had happened, the chief Prieſts would have ſaid that his Diſciples ſtole him away before they began their watch; but the chief Prieſts could not plead that excuſe becauſe they went preſently to the ſepulchre, and made it ſure, ſealing the ſtone, and ſetting a watch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 66. Hence it follows, that they went to <hi>Pilate</hi> in the beginning of their next Ceremonial day, namely preſently after Sun-ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they began their Feſtival Supper.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Pilates</hi> anſwer to their requeſt implies that they came over-night, for <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaith, <hi>You have a Watch, go make it ſure as you know.</hi> Hence it follows, that they came to <hi>Pilate</hi> when Watches were wont to be ſet; but if they had not come to him til the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then in reaſon he would have ſaid, <hi>Get Warders, and make it ſure.</hi> Hence it follows, that the next day in which they came to <hi>Pilate</hi> was at the Sun-ſet Evening, for that was their next day, or it was their morrow, as I have opened, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 15. All theſe conſiderations laid together make it evident that the time ere Chriſt was incloſed in the heart of the earth, was when the Sabbath began to lighten with ſtars.</p>
               <p>Object. 13. <hi>How can you call their Feſtival Supper the proper Feaſt that doth moſt properly belong to the first day of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened-bread; had they not a Feſtival Dinner belonging to this High Sabbath as well as a Feſtival Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant they had a Feſtival Dinner belonging to this day, as well as a Feſtival Supper; but my meaning is, that their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival Dinner was not intirely made of the ſacrifices of this day, as their Feſtival Supper was: for part of their Feſtival Dinner (at leaſt) was made of the Remainder of thoſe Peace-offerings which were ſacrificed in the former day with the Lamb-Paſſeover, and ſo by that means their feſtival Dinner did partake of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the fourteenth day; but their Feſtival Supper was made intirely of the Sacrifices of the fifteenth day, and yet this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Feaſt was kept in the night after the date of the Ceremonial beginning of the ſixteenth day, in which none of the fleſh of their Chagigah-Paſſeover might remain, for that had been to keep the holy fleſh within the third day, which was plainly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the letter of the Law: Hence it followes, that all the fleſh of their Chagigah-Paſſeover muſt be eaten at Dinner, or elſe if any of it did remain untill the beginning of the ſixteenth day it muſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36425:52"/>
be burnt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17. and therefore it follows that this high Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Supper was intirely made of the Sacrifices of the fifteenth day, and in that reſpect, it was the moſt proper ſolemn Feaſt of this High Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Object 14. <hi>It ſeems to me that</hi> Moſes <hi>doth allow the fleſh of the Chagigah-Paſſeover to remain unto the morning of the third day, in</hi> Deu. 16. 4. <hi>and that is a longer time than you ſpeak of from</hi> Lev. 7. 17. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning, is put for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Jews Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial day at Sun-ſet.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ. Boker,</hi> the morning, in <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 4. muſt not be taken in a proper ſenſe, either for the beginning of the natural day, or of the morning of the Artificial day; but in this place, it muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken figuratively for the beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day at Sun-ſet; for as <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning, is properly put for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Natural day, or of the Artificial day, ſo alſo it is figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively put for the beginning of any other thing (as in Chap. 3. I have given ſeveral inſtances) and accordingly in this place it is figuratively put for the beginning of the Ceremonial day at Sun-ſet; for <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. might not give a contrary Law to what he had before given in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17. There he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, that none of the fleſh of the voluntary Peace-offerings ſhall remain untill the third day, if any thing thereof remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the third day it ſhall be burnt. Hence it follows by neceſſary conſequence, that <hi>Boker,</hi> the morning, in <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 4. muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a figurative ſenſe for the beginning of their Ceremonial day at Sun-ſet, and therefore none of the fleſh of the Chagigah-Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>(Moſes</hi> doth not ſpeak of the Lamb-Paſſeover in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. but of the Cagigah-Paſſeover) of Sheep and Oxen, which were ſacrificed in the fourteenth day with the Paſchal Lamb, none of this fleſh might remain untill the beginning, or untill the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſixteenth day at Sun-ſet, for then the fleſh would have remained untill the third day after it was ſacrificed, and then might not be eaten, but it muſt be burnt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors teſtifie, that the fleſh of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Peace-offerings muſt remain but one whole night after it was ſacrificed, and ſo conſequently but one natural morning. <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, By word of mouth we have learned that this is a prohibition for leaving the fleſh of the <hi>Cagigah</hi> of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day unto the ſixteenth day, as it ſaid <hi>[unto the morning]</hi> that is till the morning of the ſecond day. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 4. their meanings, that it ſhould not be kept untill the beginning
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36425:52"/>
(or untill the morning) of the ſixteenth day, which begins at Sun-ſet; in theſe words <hi>Moſes</hi> doth truly, though figuratively, call the Sun-ſet Evening, the morning, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 4. This is a myſtery that belongs peculiarly to the Ceremonial Law, which the inexpert cannot preſently perceive; the like myſtery it is to call the beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day, the morrow, as it is three times over called in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 11, 15, 16. and once more in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 17. as it is explained in Chap. 4. and it is called their next day in <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 62.</p>
               <p>And it is a further myſtery alſo that the Jews Ceremonial day ſhould begin ſix hours before the Natural day is ended. As for example, The fifteenth day of <hi>Niſhan</hi> was the firſt day of Unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread, and a high Sabbath, and by their Ceremonial cuſtome it began before the Evening of the fourteenth day was ended; for the Paſſeover of the fourteenth day was not feaſted on till after Sun-ſet, namely, not till after the fifteenth day by their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial account was begun, according to the date of the perſon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Theſe are Riddles to ſuch as are not ſtudious in the <hi>Jews</hi> cuſtomes: They could not keep their Religious Feſtival Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the ſame Ceremonial day, for then they muſt have kept them the night before their Sacrifices were offered, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; therefore the night after their Feſtival Sabbaths, was the proper night of the Sabbaths by Creation, though not by Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for the Ceremonial day, in which the polluted perſon muſt be purified againſt their feſtival Sabbaths, muſt needs begin the date of their new day before hand; and yet they muſt alſo keep the Feſtival Supper appertaining to the Sabbath in the night after, and ſo by this means, the Ceremonial day was interwoven with the Natural day for the ſeveral reſpects already named, and therefore this phraſe, It ſhall be eaten in the ſame day, in which the Sacrifice was offered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 30. muſt not, nor cannot be underſtood of the ſame Ceremonial day, but it may, and muſt be underſtood of the ſame Natural day.</p>
               <p>Object. 15. <hi>What need had they to keep their Religious Feaſts in the night after the Sabbath? was not the whole day from Sun-ſet to Sun-ſet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

becauſe many times the Evening ſacrifices were not finiſhed till Sun-ſet, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 14. therefore they muſt of neceſſity have the night after as the appointed ſeaſon for the ſolemnity of their Religious Suppers; and therefore the Sun-ſet Evening before was not the beginning of the Natural day, it was but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the new day to the perſon purified, he muſt of neceſſity begin his new day then, or elſe he could not partake in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of their Sacrifices the day following; but the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath was a natural part of the former day, and the proper Feaſt of the Sabbath was then celebrated; and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath reference to this Cuſtome, when he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall have a Song as in the Night, when a holy Solemnity is kept,</hi> Iſa. 30. 29. for they kept their Religious Suppers till Mid-night, and it is evident that all their Religious Feaſts were kept with ſongs and with ſuch like expreſſions of joy in the Meſſiah for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>Deu.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Judg.</hi> 21. 19, 21. and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, all kind of ſadneſſe and mourning was forbidden at their ſolemn Feaſts, becauſe it did prophane that joyful Ordinance, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I confeſſe the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do expound the word Morning in this Text to mean day-break, but yet they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo often correct that Expoſition, for they ſay more than once, that they feared it might be a tranſgreſſion to continue the time of their ſolemne Suppers any longer than till Mid-night.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, That not onely the ſacrifice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Peace-offerings (but of other kinds of ſacrifices alſo) might be eaten all the night long till break of day; As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, The Nazarites Ram, and the bread that came with it, whether it were the portion of the Prieſts, or the portion of the Owners, Theſe might be eaten all the night long til break of day; and the ſame law they ſay was for the Sin-offerings, and for the Treſpas-offerings, &amp; for the Peace-offerings of the Congregation, and for the reſidue of the Meat-offerings: <hi>All theſe</hi> (ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:36425:53"/>
Doctors, <hi>may be eaten all the night long till break of day: But yet</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maymony) To keep men far from Tranſgreſſion, our wiſe men have ſaid, They are not to be eaten, but untill MIDNIGHT.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, they ſay of the reſidue of the Burnt-offerings, that they might lye burning upon the Altar all the night long untill the morning; that is (ſay they) till break of day, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9. but yet they do alſo correct that Interpretation; for they ſay, <hi>Our wiſe men have ſaid, that the Prieſts might not let the fats or peeces of the Burnt-offering lye burning upon the Altar, but untill Mid-night, for fear of Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay alſo, that they might continue feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the fleſh of the Paſchal Lamb till morning, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 10. that is (ſay they) till break of day; but yet they ſay alſo that none of the company might eat again after he had ſlept, though it were in the beginning of the night. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 10. Hence it is evident that they did allow none to make any more but one diſtinct meal of the Paſchal Lamb; and truly ſo ſmall a creature needed not ſo long a time to feaſt on it (but their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Peace-offerings which they offered with the Paſchal Lamb, and in that reſpect did call them the Paſſeover, they might feaſt upon that fleſh till day-break, for they had two dayes allowance to eat them by the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7<hi>:</hi> 17, 18.) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing they might make but one meal of the Lamb-Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, why ſhould any man think of a longer time to feaſt on it than till the Mid-night Morning? if it had been requiſite to feaſt on it till day break, our Saviour would have improved the full time; but it is evident that he did finiſh all by Mid-night, not onely the Supper of the Paſchal Lamb, but alſo the Peace-offerings, which he adjoyned to the Paſchal Lamb, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 12. (This 12. Ver. ſaith, when he was ſet down again, namely, afer he had ended the Lamb-Paſſeover in Verſe 2. then he aroſe from Supper, and waſhed his Diſciples feet, Verſe 3. then he ſate down again to feaſt upon the Chagigah-Paſſeover, Verſe 12. At which Feaſt they uſed to drink two or three cups of Wine, which our Saviour improved for the inſtitution of his own Supper; they had no common Supper this night as ſome unadviſedly ſpeak, but all the fleſh they ate was holy fleſh, and all their Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was with Religious joy for their Redemption) together with his long Exhortations, Thankſgivings, Prayers and Pſames.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36425:54"/>
I apprehend it was much about the time of Mid-night, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, when he had ended all.</p>
               <p>And it doth further appear that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did fear it might be a Tranſgreſſion to continue at their Religious Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Jews ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the firſt half of the night to be a part of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day in the caſe of their religious Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their Paſſeovers.</note> on the <hi>Paſcha</hi> till the morning at day-break, becauſe they do often limit the time of their Religious Feaſting, but untill Mid-night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the two Lambs which were preſented as a Meat-offering, together with the Two Loaves for the Peace-offerings of the Congregation, on the day of Penticoſt, were eaten by the Prieſts in the Same Day, and in Half the Night, as the fleſh of the moſt Holy things were.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 20. By this Teſtimony it is evident, that all their holy things were eaten in the ſame day, and in half the night, except their voluntary Peace-offerings, for they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from the Law to feaſt on that fleſh two dayes, and one night, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 17, 18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2. 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider this well; for though the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors do ſometimes ſay, that the fats and the peeces of the Burnt-offering may lye burning upon the Altar all night till break of day, yet they do alſo ſay, that their Wiſe men did adviſe the Prieſts not to continue the burning upon the Altar any longer than till Mid-night, and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 8. the Lord ſaith, <hi>The fat of my Feaſt ſhall not remain untill the morning,</hi> therefore it muſt be wholly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with fire before day-break. And indeed, they might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the burning any longer than til Mid-night without manifeſt Tranſgreſſion, eſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cially at feſtival times; for at feſtival times, ſaith <hi>Maymony, The Prieſts muſt take away the aſhes from the Altar at the beginning of the third part of the night; But on Reconciliation-days they took away the aſhes at Mid-night.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 10. By this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Canon it is evident that they could not continue the burning of the fats and peeces of the Evening ſacrifices untill day-break without tranſgreſſing this neceſſary order in cleanſing the Altar by way of preparation to the morning ſacrifices, for they might not do any other work about the morning ſacrifice till the aſhes were taken from the Altar, for that was the firſt work in order to the morning ſacrifice, and they could not do that work untill the burning of the fats, and of the peeces of the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſacrifices were finiſhed; therefore they might not continue the burning any longer than till Mid-night (at ſometimes at leaſt)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36425:54"/>
without Tranſgreſſion, eſpecially in the night before the day of Reconciliation, for then the Prieſts muſt take away the aſhes from the Altar at Mid-night; and by this it is evident that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors held that the morning (namely the root of it) began at Mid-night, becauſe they did then give order to ſet things in a readineſſe for the morning Sacrifice; and after this work was done, they had many other things to ſet in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could offer the morning Sacrifice, and the uſual time of killing the morning Sacrifice was before Sun-riſing, but on Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation day it was killed at day-break. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 4. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
               <p>By theſe Records of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, we may ſee the true Reaſon why they feared it might be a Tranſgreſſion to continue the burning any longer than till Mid-night, and why they feared it might be a Tranſgreſſion to continue their Feſtival Suppers any longer than till Mid-night; it was becauſe they held the root of the morning to begin at Mid-night; And <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, <hi>Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is a Commandement that is done in the hour of the ſame.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
               <p>And hence my Anſwer is to this Objection, it is the ſafeſt way to expound the word Morning, in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 30. &amp;c. to ſignifie, that the root or the firſt beginning of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is at Mid-night, for fear of Tranſgreſſion.</p>

               <p>The meaning of theſe Paſſages is, That whereas theſe things were to be done to day, and might not be put off till to morrow: If they were done any time before Mid-night, it was reputed cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as done to day.</p>
               <p>Their Phylacteries were to be ſaid over every day at Even: If they were ſaid over before Mid-night, it ſerved the turn for the day before.</p>
               <p>And the parts of the Offerings that were to be eaten in the ſame day that the Offering was offered (and might not be kept till the morrow) if they were eaten before Mid-night, it did ſerve the turn for the day before.</p>
               <p>The Altar of Burnt-offering was to be cleanſed every day; but on the day of Expiation it began to be cleanſed from the Mid-night before, and that was taken as done on the day of Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>Theſe things I have produced the rather, becauſe of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 35. which calls it the Morning; and yet it was <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Were I to diſcuſſe the Queſtion about the beginning and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Chriſtian Sabbath, I ſhould think this matter worth conſideration to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And ſomething parallel to this are thoſe Texts in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 22.

               <p>Secondly, I come now to ſpeak of the ſecond Part of the Paſſeover Evening, which was for the uſe of their Religious Feaſting from Sun-ſet to mid-night.</p>
               <p>After my long digreſſion to anſwer ſeveral Objections about the <hi>Iews</hi> cuſtoms, I come now to ſpeak of the ſecond part of the Paſſeover Evening, appointed for the time of their religious Feaſting on their Paſſeovers, and that was from Sun-ſet to Mid-night, and this ſpace of time was all the latter evening.</p>
               <p>And this is evident,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 By the appointment of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </item>

               </list>
               <p>1 <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to eat the fleſh of the Paſchal Lamb [In that Night] <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8, 42. namely in that part of the night that belonged to the fourteenth day by Creation.</p>
               <p>2 It is evident that Chriſt did not ſit down to eat the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with his twelve Apoſtles, until the latter evening was come; for Chriſt himſelf was in the fore-noon, or in the beginning of the after-noon at <hi>Bethany,</hi> when he ſent two of his Diſciples to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to prepare the Paſſeover, and to preſent it to the Prieſts to be killed for them all between the two evenings, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 3. 12. 13. then after it was ſacrificed he bad them carry it to ſuch a houſe, and make it ready againſt his coming, and in thus doing he did according to the <hi>Iews</hi> cuſtom, for their cuſtom was, that if thirteen or twenty did joyn together for one Paſſeover, they did ſend one or two of their company to preſent it to the Prieſt, and ſo to make it ready for the reſt. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 12. then at Sun-ſet they all met together, and began the feaſt at the hour appointed. This cuſtom our Saviour obſerved, for he came not in perſon to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> til the latter evening was come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 20. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 17. and when he was come he did not ſit down to eat until the appointed hour was come, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 14. this hour in general was the latter evening at Sun-ſet, but the particular hour of their feaſting was not by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors Canons untill three Stars did appear after Sun-ſet. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:36425:56"/>
2 It is evident that our Saviour did not begin to Feaſt on his Paſſeover untill the ſaid evening was come, and it is evident alſo, that he finiſhed all his religious exerciſes and ſolemnities within the ſpace of this latter evening, from ſun-ſet till mid-night, as I have opened the matter more in my anſwer to the ſixteenth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>Object. 17. <hi>How can you prove that the Paſſeover-Supper was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the night of the fourteenth day, ſeeing you confeſſe that the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day began that night at Sun-ſet; and the</hi> Hebrew <hi>Doctors affirm, that the fleſh of the Paſchal Lamb was eaten in the fifteenth night; how then can that night appertain both to the fourteenth, and to the fifteenth day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was the fifteenth night, according to the date of the perſon purified, as I have opened the matter in chap. 4. and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but in regard of the Feaſt it did ſtill properly appertain to the fourteenth day. As for example, if a <hi>Iew</hi> were defiled on the Paſſeover day by any of the lighter ſorts of uncleaneſſes, what courſe muſt he take that he might not be deprived of the Paſſeover Feaſt? the anſwer is, he muſt bathe or baptiſe himſelf in Water, at the looking forth of the evening, that is to ſay, in the after-noon; And what then? might hee then carry his Lamb to the Temple to be ſacrificed? No, he might not yet go himſelf to the Temple, becauſe his clenſing was not fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; but yet he might joyn with others, and cauſe others to kill the Paſſeover for him, becauſe he was now in his firſt degree of cleanſing, and then as ſoon as the Sun was fully gone down upon him he was fully clean, and then he began the date of his day of cleaneneſſe, and then as ſoon as three Stars appeared after Sun-ſet, he might ſit down with the reſt of that Society to eat the Paſſeover. See <hi>Ains.</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
               <p>And thus the Sun-ſet evening was the fifteenth day to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon purified, and yet it was properly the fourteenth day ſtill, in reſpect of feaſting on the Sacrifices; and thus theſe two actions of Feaſting and Purifying may wel bear the date of two ſeverall days thus enter-woven together, without any confuſion or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It was neceſſary that the Perſon purified ſhould begin the date of his new day as ſoon as his Ceremonial cleaneneſſe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the ſetting of the Sun upon him after his Baptiſing, as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36425:56"/>
I have opened the matter in chap. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It was alſo as neceſſary that the ſolemn act of feaſting upon the fleſh of their Sacrifices ſhould bear the date of the ſame day with the ſaid Sacrifices; 1 Becauſe the act of Feaſting received no new degree of cleaneneſſe at Sun-ſet, as the perſon purified did. 2. Becauſe the act of feaſting in the latter evening after Sun-ſet had a neceſſary dependence upon the act of Sacrificing in the former evening, for the act of feaſting on the Holy fleſh in the latter evening was but to help on the Spiritual appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that document that was typified and exhibited by the ſacrifice in the former evening; therefore ſeeing the act of feaſting had ſuch a neceſſary dependence upon the act of ſacrificing, I ſee no reaſon why this continued Sacramental Paſſeover ſhould bear the date of two ſeveral proper Natural days; I ſee no reaſon why the act of feaſting ſhould bear the date of the fifteenth day, except it be only in relation to the date of the perſon purified, and thus <hi>Maymony</hi> above cited muſt be underſtood, that the fleſh of the Paſchal Lamb was eaten on the fifteenth night, namely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the date of the perſon purified, though in regard of the Feaſt it ſelf it was but the fourteenth night ſtill, as in my next an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at fifthly I have cited his words.</p>
               <p>Obj. 18. <hi>I deſire to ſee yet further, how you can prove that the latter evening at Sun-ſet was a true part of the fourteenth day in the caſe of their religious Feaſting upon the Paſſeover.</hi>

                  </gap>, and yet the Feaſt was kept after Sun-ſet. Hence it follows, that the time of feaſting on the Paſchal Lamb after Sun-ſet was a true part of the fourteenth day by Creation, though it was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

of the fifteenth day to the perſon purified.</p>
               <p>2 It is evident, that the Sun-ſet evening is a true part of the ſame fourteenth day by Creation, by <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 11. In the ſecond Month, in the fourteenth day of the Month, between the two evenings they ſhall do it, with unleavened Cakes, and bitter Herbs ſhall they eat it.</p>
               <p>In this text <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ſpeak of a Two-fold action to be done in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month; He ſpeaks of doing it, namely according to the Command, that is to ſay, of ſacrificing it between the two evenings; Secondly, He ſpeaks of the act of feaſting with unleavened Cakes, and bitter Herbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not diſtribute theſe two Sacramental actions unto two ſeverall Natural days, but commands them both to bee done in the ſame fourteenth day of the month.</p>
               <p>3 It is evident by <hi>Joſ.</hi> 10. 3. that they kept the Feaſt of the Paſchal Lamb on the fourteenth day of the Month at Even; <hi>Joſhuae</hi> names only the time of Feaſting (though the time of Sacrificing muſt be underſtood) he ſaith plainly, that it muſt be feaſted on in the fourteenth day of the Month at even, I cannot ſee how any man that loves plain truth can deny the Sun-ſet evening to be a true part of the former day.</p>
               <p>4 It is evident that the latter evening was a true part of the fourteenth day, becauſe the ſeven days of unleavened Bread have ſeven latter evenings belonging to them, beſides the latter evening of the fourteenth day, ſo that they obſerved eight feſtival Evenings together, and ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth number them, in <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. and hence it follows, that the Feſtival Supper which belonged to the laſt day of unleavened Bread, which was the one and twentieth day of the Month, did alſo bear the date of the two and twentieth day to the perſon purified, and this latter evening was the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſeaſon for all their Holy Feſtival Suppers, and often-times it was little enough, for they muſt boyl and roſt all the fleſh of their Peace-offerings, which were of the greater kind, as ſheep and Oxen, (for no Fowls were allowed for Peace-offerings. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 3. 6.) this did much increaſe the quantity of their Proviſions, and therefore it required the longer time both to Cook it, and to feaſt on it; and all theſe days of Feaſting were commanded to be done with great ſolemnity, eſpecially the firſt and the laſt, and with many relations of Gods goodneſſe for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36425:57"/>
their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and with Songs and Pſalms of praiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 7. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8. and in this reſpect the latter evening was a competent time for theſe religious Solemnities, and to continue the time of feaſting longer, was a tranſgreſſion: for it is expreſly commanded in <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15. that the holy fleſh muſt be eaten in the ſame day in which it was ſacrificed; But if the Sun-ſet evening had been the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Natural day, then this Holy fleſh could not have been eaten the ſame day, as I have noted the reaſon thereof for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and then God by <hi>Moſes</hi> had commanded us to do that which is not poſſible to be done; therefore the Sun-ſet evening is a true part of the ſame Natural day wherein the fleſh was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith (as I noted in objection ſixteen) that the Prieſts did eat the two Loaves which were preſented to the Lord with the Meat-offering of the Congregation on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoſt, in the ſame day, and in half the night, as the fleſh of the moſt holy things were. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 20. ſo then, in the judgement of the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors (for <hi>Maymony</hi> doth but record their judgement) the latter evening till mid-night was a true part of the ſame Natural day, in which the Sacrifices were offered, though yet notwithſtanding the purified perſon began the date of his new day at the Sun-ſet afore.</p>
               <p>5 Thus (ſaith <hi>Maymony)</hi> after he had related divers circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the Paſſeover, then is brought in a Table furniſhed with bitter Herbs, unleavened Bread, and the Body of the Paſchal Lamb, and the fleſh <hi>Chagigah,</hi> which is (ſaith he) for the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the Month, he doth not ſay which is for the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the Month (though otherwiſe he doth call this time the fifteenth day of the Month) both are true in a right ſenſe, namely in the ſenſe formerly given) and in another place <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, The evening of the fourteenth of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He makes the time of feaſting to belong to the fourteenth day; and ſecondly, he preferres this evening to the evening of the Feſtival Sabbaths, and therefore preſcribes a greater puniſhment for ſervile work done on this evening, than for working in the evening before the Feſtival Sabbaths, for ſo is the compariſon to be made, as I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36425:58"/>
have noted it elſewhere, becauſe in this evening was ſolemnized the proper Feaſt of the fourteenth day; but the evening before was but in way of preparation to the Sabbath it ſelf. Thirdly, <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, They ſearched out Leaven in the beginning of the night of the fourteenth day; <hi>Maymony</hi> calls the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Feaſt of the unleavened Bread the fourteenth night, and yet in another place he calleth it the fifteenth day.</p>
               <p>Thus have I proved, not only by Scripture, but alſo by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that the Sun-ſet evening is a true part of the former day, though it be alſo the beginning of a new day to the perſon purified, by a Ceremonial inſtitution.</p>

               <p>This Evening of the ninth day hath a double interpretation.</p>
               <p>1 Some underſtand it of the ſacrifice-Evening of the ninth day.</p>
               <p>2 Some underſtand it of the Evening at the end of the ninth day where the tenth day begins</p>
               <p n="1">1 In the firſt ſenſe, <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, <hi>They began to afflict their ſouls in the Evening of the ninth day, next before the tenth day, and ſo they tarried in their affliction a little in the night after the tenth day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words you ſee that <hi>Maymony</hi> doth not hold this faſt to begin with the tenth day at the Sun-ſet Evening, according to the date of the new day of the perſon purified; but in the evening of the ninth day, next before the tenth day<hi>:</hi> And <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> ſaith moreover, <hi>That they muſt abide in their affliction a little in the night after the tenth day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This early beginning, and this late ending of this faſting-day doth increaſe the length of this day, beyond the length of any other faſting-day, or of any other Sabbath day.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This clauſe <hi>[In]</hi> the ninth day of the month, in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is thus read by the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters, From the ninth of the month, from the Evening; and thus they vary the Prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from <hi>[In]</hi> to <hi>[From]</hi> and their Tranſlation agreeth fitly to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36425:59"/>
the next clauſe from Even unto Even you ſhall Reſt your Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; and by this reading, we may ſee that the Seventy do make the latter Evening of the ninth day, to be a true part of the ninth day, though it were alſo the beginning of the tenth day accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the date of the perſon purified.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Hence it is alſo evident, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not hold the naturall beginning of the tenth day to begin at the Sun-ſet evening of the ninth day, for then <hi>Moſes</hi> words ſhould have run thus, From the tenth of the month from the Evening; but <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not ſay ſo, but from the ninth of the month from the Evening, either he muſt mean it to begin from the Sacrifice-Evening of the ninth day, as <hi>Maymony</hi> expounds it; or ſecondly, from the latter Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ninth day (as a true part of the ninth day) as the Seventy underſtand it; or thirdly, from the Ceremonial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ninth day, which begins at the Sun-ſet Evening before the ninth day. But then,</p>
               <p n="4">4 If you will take this phraſe from Even to Even to be from the Evening of the ninth day, according to the date of the perſon purified, then all the ninth day muſt be a faſting day as well as the tenth day, for the Evening of the ninth day is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ninth day according to the date of the perſon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; but if you deſire to avoid this groſſe abſurdity, then you muſt grant that the natural Evening of the ninth day did not begin, but end the ninth day, as the Seventy Interpreters do carry it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 They that do place the natural Evening at the beginning of the ninth day, and yet do allow the Sacrifice Evening to be placed at the end of the ninth day, they do thereby place the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural morning of the ninth day between the two Evenings of the ninth day, and ſo they do make the morning Sacrifice to be killed between the two Evenings; but when men will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth in the love of it, it is juſt with God to let them run into ſuch abſurd conſequences as theſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6 This faſting-day was longer than any other faſting-day; for <note place="margin">No faſting-day among the Jews was ſo long as the Faſt on the day of Attone<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment was.</note> all other publick faſting dayes were left to the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> to be appointed whenſoever they were in any diſtreſs, which were proclamed to be obſerved in all the Synagogues of the Land, as well as at the Temple: But they did not injoyn them to begin thoſe faſting dayes in the Evening before, with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36425:59"/>
ſuch a ſtrict abſtinence as they did the day of Reconciliation; for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, <hi>That it was lawfull for them to eat in the night, when the feaſt was on the morrow.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Nu.</hi> 9. 10. By this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Maymony,</hi> it is evident that they began all their other ſolemn faſting-dayes in the morning, and not in the evening before, except the day of Reconciliation only; therfore no other publick faſting-day was of ſuch a length as this yeerly faſting-day was.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Neither was any other Sabbath of ſuch a length for ſtrict Reſt as this faſting-Sabbath was, for they muſt begin the ſtrict Reſt of this day, either in the Sacrifice Evening of the ninth day, or at the beginning of the latter Evening of the ninth: But they did not begin the ſtrict Reſt neither of their feſtival Sabbaths, nor of the Sabbath or ſeventh day in the Evening before, as they did this yeerly faſting-Sabbath; For <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, <hi>Such works as may be done on the Evening of a Feaſt-day, they do not upon a Feaſt-day, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Ain.</hi> in 23. 7. By this teſtimony it is evident, that they did not hold the Evening before their feſtival-Sabbaths to be as holy as the day it ſelf.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, It is unlawful to do works in the Evening of the feſtival Sabbaths, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice, and forwards, Even as on the Evenings of the Sabbaths; and who ſo doth work in them ſhall never ſee a ſign of a Beſſing, and he is to be rebuked, and to be made to leave off by force, though he is not for it to be ſcourged or excommunicated, except in the Evening of the Paſſeover after Mid-day whoſo doth work therein after Mid-day, is to be ſcourged, or excommunicated with the <hi>Niddui;</hi> for the Evening of the fourteenth day of <hi>Niſhan,</hi> is not like the Evening of other feſtival dayes, becauſe in it are the Feaſt, and the killing of Sacrifices. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
               <p>Two things are obſervable from this Record of <hi>Maymony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 That the <hi>Jews</hi> did make ſome kind of preparation, both to their feſtival-Sabbaths, and to their Sabbath or ſeventh day, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice, and forwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hence it is evident, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did not eſteem any part of the Evening before their Sabbaths, to be as holy as the day following, becauſe they did neither ſcourge, nor excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any man, for working in the Evening before their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, as they did for working in the Paſſeover Evening; and the reaſon is plain, becauſe they eſteemed both the parts of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over-Evening
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36425:60"/>
to be the very day of the Paſſeover it ſelf; but it ſeems they did not eſteem the Evening before the Sabbath to be any true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, for doubtleſſe, if they had eſteemed it as a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, they would not onely have ſcourged and excommunicated ſuch perſons, that did preſume to work in the Evening, before the Sabbath, but alſo they would have ſtoned them to death, if they had preſumptuouſly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the reſt of the holy Sabbath, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 35. And as <hi>Maymony</hi> makes the Evening of the Paſſeover, not like the Evening that went before their feſtival Sabbaths, nor like the Evening that went before their weekly Sabbath; So I may ſay of the Evening that went before the day of Attonement, that it was more ſtrict for holy reſt than the Evening that went before any of the other Sabbaths.</p>
               <p>From all the Premiſes, I conclude, that no day in all the yeer was commanded to be of ſuch a length for ſtrict Reſt as this day was, for the ſtrict Reſt of this day, and the ſtrict Faſt of this day began in the Sacrifice Evening, or elſe at the beginning of the latter Evening of the ninth day, and it continued not onely till a little after the Sun-ſet Evening of the tenth day, as <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith, But alſo it continued longer, for ſome of the holy duties of the tenth day, could not be finiſhed till Mid-night after; for</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Prieſts muſt eat their part of the publick Sin-offering, <hi>Num.</hi> 29. 11. which muſt be eaten in the ſame day in which it was offered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 26. (as other Sacrifices were, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 15, 18.) and yet the Prieſts could not eat the holy fleſh of this publick Sin-offering till after Sun-ſet; for the faſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of this day was not fully ended till after Sun-ſet, and therefore alſo they might not begin to Cook that holy fleſh untill the Faſt was fully ended. Hence it follows, that the ſame day did ſtill continue till after Sun-ſet, yea untill it was Mid-night.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Prieſts had another work to do within the limits of this tenth day, namely, they muſt burn all the fats and peeces of all the publick Evening-ſacrifices of this day (which were many) and ſome of their Evening-ſacrifices were alſo offered neer unto Sun-ſet, and therefore this work and duty of burning would require not only the more diligence, but alſo the more time, to finiſh this ſweet ſavor upon the Lords Altar in its own proper day, as I have noted the commanded ſeaſon thereof more at large in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:36425:60"/>
3 It appears, that ſome of the works which appertained to the morning-ſacrifice of this tenth day, muſt begin at Mid-night, and that ſome of the works which muſt be done about the Evening-ſacrifice were ſuch as could not be ended untill the Mid-night after.</p>
               <p>For the firſt work that muſt be done on this day in preparation to the Morning-ſacrifice was the taking away the aſhes from the Altar, and theſe aſhes they muſt begin to take away at Mid-night, as <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 10. And in an other place he ſaith, they took away the aſhes at Mid-night, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the wood, &amp;c. and at the break of day they began to kill the daily Morning-ſacrifice. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
               <p>In like ſort they could not finiſh the burning of all the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſacrifices of this day till Mid-night, as I have ſhewed above from <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 9. and yet over and above this full day from Mid-night to Mid-night, they began their ſtrict Faſt, and their ſtrict Reſt, in the Evening of the ninth day, which did increaſe the length of this day to be an extraordinary long Faſting-Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude, That the beginning of this day cannot be alleged as an exemplary pattern, neither for the beginning of any other Faſting-day, nor yet for the beginning of our Lords day, as it is intended by thoſe that allege it for the beginning and ending of the <hi>Jews</hi> weekly Sabbath from Even to Even.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This expoſition of the beginning of the Sun-ſet evening, and of the beginning of the Sabbath, is a new-found deviſe, I have already ſhewed the vanity of it in Chapter 4. in my anſwer to Obj. 2. That the Sun-ſet evening is truly come as ſoon as ever the Body of the Sun is gone out of fight, and that Darkneſſe is then begun, becauſe the ſhining of the Sun is gone from off the face of the earth, and Darkneſſe is ſaid to begin at the going down of the Sun, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 17. and then the <hi>Jews</hi> began to ſet their Night-watches, and then the purified perſon began the date of the day of his cleaneneſſe, and therefore if the Sabbath it ſelf did begin in the evening at all, it began then, namely according to the date of the day of the purified perſon, which began as ſoon as ever the Body of the Sun was gone out of ſight, as I have ſhewed in chap. 4. and then if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not ſet a Watch at the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till the darkneſſe in the Skie was more than the light in the Skie, he did not that which was ſufficient to preſerve the Holy reſt of the Holy Sabbath, eſpecially ſeeing they began to make ſome preparation to the obſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice before, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors.</p>

Hence it follows, that he muſt be incloſed in the heart of the earth, in the very ſelf-ſame Friday in which he was Crucified; for the firſt day of the Week in which he aroſe from the Dead, is called the third Day after, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 4. and in theſe reſpects it is of neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence

to deſcribe the preciſe time both of his Burial, and alſo of his Reſurrection, or elſe a doubting Conſcience cannot be rightly eſtabliſhed in the truth of his three days lying in the Grave.</p>
               <p>But ſuch as hold the Sabbath to begin at the Sun-ſet evening can never prove it, unleſſe they can prove that Chriſt was inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the heart of the earth ſome diſtinct time before Sun-ſet; but <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, that the time of Chriſts Burial was, when it began to be Star-light, Luk. 23. 54.</note> that is not poſſible to be done, for <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, that the Sabbath began to lighten (with Star-light) when he was incloſed in his Grave, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 54.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Broughton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weames,</hi> and the <hi>Syriac</hi> do render the Tranſlation ſo, and the Seventy uſe the ſame Greek word in <hi>Job</hi> 25. 5. for the light of the Moon, and it may as well be uſed for the light of the Stars, for they are called Stars of light, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14, 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 3.</p>
               <p>Let all the circumſtances of time about the burial of Chriſt bee caſt up, and laid together, and then it will put the matter out of doubt, that the burial of Chriſt could not be finiſhed till it was Sar-light.</p>
               <p>1 Conſider the time when <hi>Joſeph</hi> went to <hi>Pilate</hi> to begge the Body, and that was not till the Sun-ſet evening was come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 57. <hi>Mar.</hi> 15. 42. This evening that was now come cannot be underſtood of the firſt evening, for that was come at Mid-day, and Chriſt was then alive, therefore it muſt be underſtood of the latter evening which was not come till Sun-ſet.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>But Mr.</hi> Norton <hi>objecteth againſt this Tranſlation, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In his Treatiſe of Chriſts Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaith, that it is not true that</hi> Joſeph <hi>came not to begge the Body of Chriſt untill Sun-ſet; but</hi> Joſeph <hi>(ſaith he) came as the evening was coming, as the Greek hath it, therefore before it was actually come; and beſides, (ſaith he) he could not otherwiſe have taken down the Body, and buried it the ſame day according to the Law,</hi> Deut. 21. 23. <hi>which</hi> John <hi>teſtifieth they were carefull and mindfull of,</hi> Joh. 19. 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As touching the tranſlation of the Greek in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> I have ſearched into ſundry Tranſlations, and all that I can yet meet withall have it, <hi>When the evening was come;</hi> I have alſo conferred with ſome that are learned in the Tongues, and they ſay it is but a harſh tranſlation to render it, <hi>When the evening was coming;</hi> and <hi>Tindall</hi> doth both tranſlate and expound <hi>Mar</hi> 15. 42 thus, <hi>When night was come</hi> (becauſe it was the evening that goeth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36425:62"/>
before the Sabbath) But what if the Greek doth ſignifie no more but as Maſter <hi>Norton</hi> ſaith, when the evening was coming? yet that tranſlation makes the difference of time ſo ſmall that it is not worth the ſpeaking of, for in the like caſe <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, <hi>That at the evening, when the Sun was ſet, the</hi> Jews <hi>brought their diſeaſed perſons to Chriſt to be cured,</hi> Mark 1. 32. but <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>It was when the Sun was ſetting,</hi> Luk. 4. 40. that is to ſay, when the evening was coming, for in proper ſpeech, the latter evening cannot be ſaid to be coming till the Sun be ſetting.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, It ſeems to me that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> durſt not go to <hi>Pilate</hi> to beg the dead Body before Sun-ſet, for fear of the diſpleaſure of the High Prieſts, and therefore he delayed his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Pilate</hi> untill the High Prieſts had firſt gone and beſought <hi>Pilate</hi> that their leggs might be broken, and that they might bee taken down, becauſe it was the time of their preparation to their High Feſtival Sabbath-Supper, for <hi>Joſeph</hi> knew that the High Prieſts were deſirous that Chriſt ſhould hang upon the Croſſe for his greater ignominy, as long as other curſed Malefactors uſed to do, and that was untill the Sun was ſet, and in this ſenſe <hi>Joſhua</hi> did underſtand the Law to mean, namely, that they might <note place="margin">Deut. 21. 23.</note> hang upon the Tree after the night was begun (which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at Sun-ſet) and therefore he did not command the dead Bodies of the curſed Kings to be taken down from the Tree untill the Sun was down, <hi>Joſ</hi> 8. 29.</p>
               <p>I grant that formerly I have expounded this clauſe in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. <hi>Thou ſhalt not let his Carkaſſe hang all night upon the tree,</hi> to mean (not at all in the night) but ſince then I finde upon better examination that I was in an error, though Maſter <hi>Norton</hi> takes it for a truth, and ſo in like ſort he takes ſome plain truths for great errors; but this ſentence, they ſhal not hang all night, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that they may hang ſome part of the night upon the tree, provided they were buried the ſame day, namely in the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural day, which laſted after Sun-ſet untill Mid-night, as I have ſhewed in chap. 5. in my anſwer to Object. 16.</p>
               <p>And in this reſpect <hi>Ioſhua</hi> let the dead Bodies of the Kings hang ſtill upon the Tree untill the Sun was ſet; that is to ſay, untill the night was begun; but if this command of burying them in the ſame day had meant in the ſame Ceremonial day, then the dead Bodies might not continue hanging on the Tree untill the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36425:62"/>
Sun was ſet, except they had been buried ſome diſtinct time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sun-ſet; this clauſe therefore <hi>[in the ſame day]</hi> muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not of the ſame Ceremonial day which ended at Sun-ſet, but of the ſame Natural day which continued after Sun-ſet till mid-night, as I have ſhewed more at large in Chapter five, in my anſwer to Objection ſixteen, and in chap. 4. <hi>ult.</hi> and in other places alſo.</p>
               <p>The chief Prieſts were firſt in their requeſt to <hi>Pilate,</hi> becauſe it was the time of their preparation to their ſolemn High Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Supper, for it was the firſt day of unleavened bread, which was a high Sabbath, and their Feſtival-Supper was to begin at Star-light, therefore they beſought <hi>Pilate</hi> that their leggs might be broken, and that they might be taken away, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 31. thus you ſee that the Prieſts in regard of their preparation to their Sabbath-Supper were firſt in their requeſt unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> preſently upon this <hi>Pilate</hi> commanded that their leggs ſhould be broken, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> perceiving their requeſt, firſt did wiſely eſpy the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of time, and without delay he went boldly unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> and beſought him, that he might take away the Body of Jeſus, and <hi>Pilate</hi> gave him leave; he came therefore and took the Body of Jeſus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 38. this was all done in the neck of one another, and this time is recorded by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> to be when the Sun-ſet evening was done.</p>
               <p>From the Premiſes I reaſon thus; If the Sun-ſet evening was come before <hi>Ioſeph</hi> went to <hi>Pilate</hi> to begge the Body of Chriſt, then the Sabbath Star might well be riſen before the Body of Chriſt could be incloſed in the heart of the earth, for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had many things to do after he had the grant of the dead Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could be incloſed in his Grave; Firſt, he went to the Shops to buy ſeverall peeces of Linnen to wrap the dead Body in, according to the <hi>Iews</hi> manner, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 6, 7. (as we may ſee the manner in <hi>Lazarus</hi> burial, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 44.) and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> alſo did take up ſome time to imbalm his Body, which alſo was done with many circumſtances according to the <hi>Iews</hi> cuſtome, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 40. (as it is ſet down by Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 4. and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 2.) and then (though the place of burial were near, yet) it would require both hands and time to carry him thither, and to rowl the ſtone upon the mouth of his Grave, before hee could be ſaid to be incloſed in the heart of the earth; I grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:36425:63"/>
that all this was done with as much haſte as might be, becauſe of the <hi>Iews</hi> preparation to their Feſtival Supper, and yet as ſoon as this was done, or could be done, their High Feſtival-Sabbath began to lighten, namely, with the Evening Star at leaſt, if not with more Stars, for it was a Canon among them, not to begin their Feſtival-Suppers till three Stars did appear, and doubtleſſe <hi>Lukes</hi> phraſe doth allude to that cuſtom. This Sabbath that did now begin to lighten was not the Sabbath it ſelf, for if the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath it ſelf had been begun at the riſing of the Evening Starre, then doubtleſſe the holy Women had broken the holy reſt of the Sabbath day, becauſe after all this they went to the ſhops and bought Odors, and Oyntments, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 56. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 1. yea and after they had bought theſe Odors and Oyntments they went home and prepared them in a readineſſe to perfume the Body of Chriſt with them as ſoon as ever the Sabbath was paſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 1. If they had bought them before his burial they would have perfumed his Body before his burial, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſeeing theſe holy Women did all this work after the burial, and after the Sabbath began to lighten, it is an evident proof that the Sabbath it ſelf did not begin neither at the Sun-ſet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the perſon purified began the date of his new day, nor yet at the riſing of the evening ſtarre, for if the Sabbath it ſelf had been begun at either of theſe times, then the holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had moſt groſly broken the holy reſt of the Sabbath; But the Holy Text doth witneſſe on their ſide that they reſted the Sabbath, according to the Commandment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 56.</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude from this practiſe of the holy Women, that though the evening before the Sabbath doth bear the date of the day following to the perſon purified, yet in proper ſpeaking it is no part of the Sabbath it ſelf, it is only to be eſteemed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath but by way of preparation, and no more.</p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwer, That your expoſition of the word before may better carry this ſenſe, namely that this latter evening was indeed before the Sabbath it ſelf, and I have ſhewed in chap. 5. that the evening of the Sabbath is put by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, ſometimes for the evening before the Sabbath, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the laſt half of the Sabbath it ſelf; but ſee more in this Chapter in the anſwer to the next objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:36425:63"/>Object. 2. <hi>It ſeems to me that the Sabbath it ſelf did begin and end at the Sun-ſet Evening by the</hi> Jews <hi>practiſe, for they held it unlawful before the Sun-ſet Evening was come for our Saviour to heal diſeaſed perſons; But after the Sun-ſet Evening was come, all manner of diſeaſed perſons came flocking to him for cure,</hi> Mar. 1. 32. <hi>Hence it appears that the</hi> Jews <hi>held the Sabbath to be fully ended as ſoon as the Sun-ſet Evening was come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is but the bare conjecture that they forbore to bring their ſick perſons till the Sabbath was ended: I deny it to be the very reaſon, I beleeve the onely reaſon why they came no ſooner, was becauſe they had no ſooner intelligence of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power to heal; you do barely affirm that the <hi>Jews</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral held it unlawful for our Saviour to heal diſeaſed perſons upon the Sabbath day, but you are deceived. <hi>Tremelius</hi> doth teſtifie from the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors that they held the contrary: They held that the perill of life did drive away the Sabbath; that is to ſay, they held it lawful to uſe any means to prevent the danger of death upon the Sabbath day. See <hi>Tremelius</hi> his <hi>Annot.</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 8. in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Teſtament; Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> alſo doth affirm from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that they held it to be a Sabbath days work to viſit the ſick; for they held that perill of life did drive away the Sabbath. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10. See alſo my former Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>2 I do alſo apprehend by the circumſtances of the ſtory, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Capernaum</hi> were not offended with our Saviour for his miraculous cure, which he did upon that Sabbath day (as the malignant Scribes and Phariſees ſometimes were) in healing one in the Synagogue that had an unclean ſpirit, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 27.</p>
               <p>3 They took no offence at him for the curing of <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother of her Feavor, preſently after he had left the ſaid Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, v 31. Therefore ſeeing they found no fault with Chriſt for neither of theſe miraculous cures before the Sabbath was ended, doubtleſs they did not forbear to bring their diſeaſed perſons in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Sabbath (for they admired the power of God in theſe miracles) and therefore as ſoon as the publick exerciſe was ended, they ſpread his fame, verſe 28. and thereupon a multitude of the diſeaſed perſons of <hi>Capernaum</hi> came to him for cure with all the poſſible ſpeed they could, as it appears by their earneſt preſſing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:36425:64"/>
after ſo ſhort a warning, for I conceive by the circumſtances of the ſtory, that it was but a little afore Sun-ſet when Chriſt left the Synagogue, and then as ſoon as he had left the Synagogue he healed <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother, which was another procuring cauſe that made the greater flocking to him; but if his miraculous cures had been done ſooner, doubtleſſe the fame thereof would have made the ſick perſons to have flocked ſooner after him.</p>
               <p>I grant that ſome of the malignant Scribes and Phariſees did ſometimes take offence at Chriſt for his miraculous healing upon the Sabbath day; But the people in general rejoyced at all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things that were done by him upon the Sabbath day, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 17. for Chriſt did now heal a poor crooked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man upon that Sabbath day, verſe 11. And when the Ruler of the Synagogue took offence at it, Chriſt (by reaſons) put him to ſilence; and the people rejoyced that Chriſt had put him to ſilence.</p>
               <p>Therefore though ſome of the malignant <hi>Jews</hi> held erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that Chriſt ought not to heal upon the Sabbath day, yet that is no good argument to prove that theſe <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Capernaum</hi> did purpoſely detain their ſick perſons till the Sabbath was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I deny it to be the Reaſon; I do apprehend rather that they did haſtily flock to him, rather than deliberately forbear till the Sabbath might be ended.</p>
               <p>4 Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> on this place ſaith, That this Evening was the Evening of the ſame day wherein Chriſt had done ſo much before, as the inference ſhews plainly.</p>
               <p>5 It is evident to me from ſeveral teſtimonies of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, that they held the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, becauſe they held it lawful to <note place="margin">The Hebrew Doctors held the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath, to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf.</note> do many things in the Sun-ſet Evening before the Sabbath, which they did not hold lawfull to be done in the Sun-ſet Evening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>The two Loaves of New Corn for the Wave-offering</hi> (on the day of Penticoſt) <hi>were not Baked on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, becauſe it was a Sabbath; nor in the Evening before, if it were a Sabbath.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 17.</p>
               <p>Two things are evident from this Teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That in the judgement of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors the Sun-ſet
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36425:64"/>
Evening after the Sabbath, was a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, becauſe they held it unlawfull to bake the ſaid two Loaves of new corn in the Evening before the day of Penticoſt, if it were a Sabbath: But they might without ſcruple have baked the ſaid two Loaves in the ſaid Evening before Penticoſt, as well as on any other Evening, if they had held that the Sabbath had then been fully ended. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hence it is evident, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors did not hold the Evening before the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, no otherwiſe than by way of preparation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Mamony</hi> gives another inſtance from the time of baking the twelve Loaves of Shew-bread; he ſaith, <hi>That the twelve Loaves of the Shew-bread might not be baked on the Sabbath, nor on a Feaſt-day, but in the Evening of the Sabbath they baked it, and ſet it in order on the morrow.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 24. 5.</p>
               <p>Hence this is remarable in this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Record; That he makes a manifeſt difference between the Evening that goes before the Sabbath, and the Sabbath it ſelf, he calls the Evening before, [the Evening of the Sabbath] by cuſtome peculiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the date of the new day to the perſon purified (as I have formerly ſhewed) he allows theſe twelve Loaves to be baked in the Evening of the Sabbath all the yeer long, except it fell out to be in the latter Evening of a Feſtival-Sabbath; and therefore it doth hence follow, that not the Evening before, but the Evening after their Feſtival-Sabbaths, was a true part of their Feſtival-Sabbaths; And ſo likewiſe <hi>Tremelius</hi> a Chriſtian <hi>Jew,</hi> doth make the Evening after the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, in his Tranſlation and note on the <hi>Syriak</hi> Teſtament in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 1.</p>
               <p>Therefore by the judgement of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val-Sabbath was not ended at Sun-ſet; and thence it follows, that if their feſtival-Sabbaths were not ended at Sun-ſet, then their weekly Sabbaths were not ended at Sun-ſet.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Who ſo laboureth in the Evening of the Sabbath, he ſhall eat in the Sabbath,</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that in the judgement of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Canons, the Evening before the Sabbath was no part of the Sabbath no otherwiſe but by way of preparation to the Sabbath; for they ſay, That he that will eat in the Sabbath, muſt labour in the Evening of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36425:65"/>
the Sabbath, namely in the Evening before the Sabbath; This they ſpeak, as I conceive, of their laborious preparing of their Manna (according to every ones palat) in a readineſs againſt the Sabbath; for though the Manna was a ready food of it ſelf, without prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſome ſtomacks, yet not to al, til it were cooked to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat; and it could not be prepared in this ſort without great labor, for it was ground in Mills, and beaten in Mortars, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 8 And in that reſpect the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay, Who ſo laboureth in the Evening of the Sabbath, ſhall eat in the Sabbath; but in caſe they neglected this work in the Evening of the Sabbath, they might not do it on the Sabbath day, but they muſt rather faſt and endure hunger for their negligence ſake.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that the Evening before, was called the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sabbath, no otherwiſe but by way of preparation, and it is called the Evening of the Sabbath from their new date to the perſon purified; his new day did ever begin at the Sun-ſet Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Such works as may be done in the Evening before a Feaſt-day they do not upon a Feaſt-day; they may not reap, nor threſh, nor winnow, nor grinde corn, nor the like upon a Sabbath day, for all theſe things may be done in the Evening of a Sabbath, killing of Beaſts, baking of bread, kneading of dough, and the like, may be done in the Evening of a Sabbath.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 7. in like ſort their laborious preparation of their Manna muſt be done in the Evening of the weekly Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>By the Evening of the Sabbath the</hi> Jews <hi>do not mean onely the Sun-ſet Evening, but they accounted the Sabbath Evening to begin at three a clock in the afternoon before; and in this reſpect</hi> Maymony <hi>ſaith thus, It is unlawful to do works in the Evenings of the Feſtival-Sabbaths from the time of the Evening ſacrifice, and forward (even as upon the Evening of the weekly Sabbaths) and who ſo doth work in them ſhall never ſee a ſign of bleſſing, and he is to be rebuked, and to be made to leave off by force, Though he is not for it to be ſcourged or excommunicated, except in the Evening of the Paſſeover after Mid-day; who ſo doth work therein after Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he is to be ſcourged or excommunicated with the Niddui, for the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Niſhan is not like the Evening of other Feſtival dayes, becauſe in it are the Feaſt, and the killing of Sacrifices.</hi> See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant that the <hi>Jews</hi> did make ſome kind of preparation
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36425:65"/>
both to their Feſtival-Sabbaths, and to their weekly Sabbaths alſo, from the time of the Evening-ſacrifice, and forwards, till Bed-time; for though they did not begin their day of cleanneſſe till Sun-ſet, yet in regard of the many works that were to be done againſt their Feaſt-dayes (which I have immediately named) and in regard of preparing their Manna, &amp;c. againſt the Sabbath, their wiſe men held it convenient to forbear, and leave off the ordinary works of their calling from the time of the Evening-ſacrifice, and forwards, till bed-time; and in that reſpect the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates themſelves did forbear to ſit in their Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature after the time of the Evening-ſacrifice. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 22. But this degree of preparation had no other command from God, but the general rule of conveniency.</p>
               <p>2 It is evident from the ſaid Teſtimony, that they did not eſteem any part of the Evening, neither before, nor after Sun-ſet, to be as a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, becauſe they did neither ſcourge nor excommunicate any man that did any ſervile work in this Evening, as they did for working in any part of the Paſſeover Evening from Mid-day till Mid-night; but if they had in their judgement eſteemed any part of the Evening before the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, doubtleſſe they would have puniſhed ſuch Tranſgreſſors more ſeverely than for working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Paſſeover Evening, for by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, ſuch perſons ought to be ſtoned to death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 34, 35.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows firſt, That the Evening before the Sabbath (though it be called the Evening of the Sabbath according to their ceremonial cuſtome, yet it) was no true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, but in way of preparation onely.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf.</p>
               <p>5 It is evident that the Evening after the Sabbath was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, by the teſtimony of the Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> in Chap. 20. 19. the Text runs thus, <hi>The ſame day at Evening, being the firſt day of the week; John</hi> calls this Evening not the ſecond, but the firſt day of the week, and yet it muſt needs be now a good ſpace after Sun-ſet, for there were two Diſciples now preſent that came from <hi>Emaus,</hi> and it was towards Evening before they came from <hi>Emaus,</hi> and they could not well come from thence to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in leſſe than three hours ſpace, for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36425:66"/>
it was ſixty Furlongs from <hi>Emaus</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke 24. 13. 29. 36.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and others, allow eight Furlongs to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> mile; but the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors allow but ſeven Furlongs and a half to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 21. The New Teſtament doth not follow the <hi>Italian</hi> Furlong, but the <hi>Greek</hi> Furlong (or <hi>ſtadium Olympicum)</hi> which contains ſix thouſand feet; and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſay that two thouſand Cubits make a mile. See <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 29. The New Teſtament doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Greek</hi> Cuſtomes as frequently as they followed the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; Therefore in reaſon as the New Teſtament was written in <hi>Greek,</hi> ſo it ſhould follow the <hi>Greek ſtadium</hi> rather than the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> beſides, I conceive that the <hi>Italian stadium</hi> came not into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe untill after the New Teſtament was written. So then by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors account, it was eight miles from <hi>Emaus</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that is to ſay, it was <hi>Eight Engliſh</hi> miles: Now if you will allow but three hours time for the going of theſe eight miles, it muſt needs be after Sun-ſet when they came to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and after they were come, they ſpent ſome time in relating unto the Apoſtles what had happened to them the ſame day as they went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> and as they were making this Relation Jeſus came and ſtood in the midſt of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 36.</p>
               <p>Theſe circumſtances conſidered, it muſt needs be after the date of the <hi>Jews</hi> Ceremonial day before Chriſt came in among them, and yet the Evangeliſt calls this time of the Evening, the ſame day in which Chriſt roſe from the dead; and ſecondly, he calls it the firſt day of the week. So then, by theſe two expreſſions the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt puts the matter out of doubt to ſuch as will be ſatisfied by plain conſequences of Scripture, that this latter Evening when Chriſt came into the houſe to the Apoſtles, was a true part of the former day, and yet it was after Sun-ſet, and therefore it was after their Ceremonial day was begun.</p>
               <p>6 And laſtly, I may well bring hither all thoſe five Arguments which I alleged in Chap. 5. to prove the latter Evening of the fourteenth day of <hi>Niſhan</hi> to be a true part of the fourteenth day, and therefore it follows by good conſequence, hat the latter Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sabbath was a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>It appears to me that the Natural day begins at the Sun-ſet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for the Lord telleth</hi> Ezekiel <hi>in the ninth year of</hi> Jeconiahs <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi>

                  <hi>that he ſhould be dumb untill the day that</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and untill a Meſſenger ſhould come to</hi> Ezekiel <hi>to tell the news thereof,</hi> Ezek. 24. 26, 27. <hi>this is the Prediction, now the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Prophecy is ſet down in</hi> Eze. 33. 21, 22. <hi>In the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth Month, and in the fifth day of the Month, then one that had eſcaped out of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>came unto</hi> Ezekiel, and ſaid, <hi>The City is ſmitten; now ſaith</hi> Ezekiel, <hi>The hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening before he that had eſcaped came, and had opened my mouth untill he came to me in the morning, and when he had opened my mouth I was no more dumb. From theſe two Scriptures compared it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the evening before the Meſſenger came, and the morning after he was come, are termed the ſame day; therefore it follows by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that the ſame day began in the evening.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a ſtrange collection to prove the evening to be the beginning of the Natural day; the vanity of this collection will appear by the opening of two words in this Prophecy, which muſt not be taken as you do, in ſtrict propriety of ſpeech, but in a figurative ſenſe, I mean the word Day, and the word Dumb.</p>
               <p>1 I ſay the word Day muſt not be taken in a ſtrict ſenſe for a proper Natural day of twenty four hours, but it muſt be taken Figuratively for a time to come, as it appears by the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time; for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ſaid to be dumb in the ninth year of <hi>Jeconiahs</hi> captivity, in the tenth Month, and in the tenth day of the Month, <hi>Eze.</hi> 24. 1, 2. in which day <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wiſe dyed, verſ. 18. which was the pleaſure of his eyes, verſ. 16. and her death was for a ſign unto the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the Temple which was the pleaſure of their eyes, verſ. 21. ſhould be deſtroyed) and then in that day (namely when the Temple ſhould be deſtroyed, he that eſcapeth in that day ſhould come to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and tell him; And in <hi>[that day]</hi> viz. in time to come, <hi>Ezekiels</hi> mouth ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto him which eſcaped to tell him, and then he ſhould ſpeak and be no more dumb, ver. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>This is the Prediction; now compare the ſtory of events, and that lyes thus, The Temple was burnt on the tenth day of the fifth Month, in the eleventh year of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Jer. 52. 12, 13. and there is no record to be found that any Meſſenger came to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to tell him in the ſame day, neither is it poſſible for any man to come from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Chaldea</hi> in one Natural day of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36425:67"/>
twenty four hours, therefore the Meſſenger that came to him in <hi>(that day)</hi> came to him in that day which is Figuratively put for the time to come, for the Meſſenger came not to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> until ſeventeen Months after that the Temple was deſtroyed, for hee came not till the fifth day of the tenth Month, and in the twelfth year of <hi>Jeconias</hi> captivity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 21. therefore this phraſe the ſame day muſt not be underſtood of the ſame Natural day, but of day at large, for the term day is often put for a large time to come, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 38, 39. &amp; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 12. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 2 See <hi>Ainſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ſaid to be dumb in the ninth year, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 12. 27. till the Meſſenger came to him in the twelfth year of <hi>Ieconiahs</hi> captivity, in all which ſpace <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was not dumb from ordinary ſpeech (as <hi>Zachary</hi> was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 20.) neither yet was he dumb from Prophecying againſt other Nations, as it appears by <hi>Eze.</hi> 26. 1. and <hi>Eze.</hi> 29. 1. and <hi>Eze.</hi> 31. but he was dumb or ſilent from Prophecying any more againſt the unbeleeving <hi>Iews,</hi> as chap. 3. 26. untill this Meſſenger came with ſpecial tidings, to certifie him how all things were accompliſhed as he had fore-told, and now at the coming of this ſpecial Meſſenger <hi>Ezekiels</hi> mouth was opened again, to utter another Prophecy of the utter ruine of the remnant of the <hi>Iews</hi> that were left, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 2, 3. and from this time forth he was no more dumb; that is to ſay, he was no more reſtrained from Prophecying to them of their utter ruine: So then, this Meſſenger was ſent to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to tell him the preſent ſtate of things, and to inquire of him what ſhould be the future event of the remnant that were left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> could not chuſe but hear of the burning of the Temple long before this Meſſenger came to him, partly by the poor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and partly by the Souldiers, and alſo he could not chuſe but hear of the death of <hi>Gedaliah</hi> before this ſpecial Meſſenger came; but ſuch accidental tidings did not anſwer to the ſign that was given for the time of his new Prophecying, for the ſign was this, That a ſpecial Meſſenger ſhould be ſent unto him from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Chaldea (in a day)</hi> that is to ſay in a time to come, and then <hi>Ezekiels</hi> mouth ſhould be opened unto him, to utter ſome new Prophecy to him, though it was not according to their expectation; for he fore-tels, that the remnant that were left ſhould likewiſe come to deſtruction.</p>

               <p>So then from all the premiſes, I conclude, that not the Evening before, but the Evening after the Sabbath was a true part of the Sabbath it ſelf, and therefore they that take liberty to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about worldly matters in the Sun-ſet Evening after the Sabbath, do prophane that holy time that God hath ſanctified to his own uſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Proving that the punctual time of Chriſts Reſurrection was in the morning, juſt at Sun-riſing.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>DOubtleſſe it is a matter of neceſſary conſequence, not onely to prove cleerly the punctual time of Chriſts burial, but of his Reſurrection alſo; for if the time of his Reſurrection be uncertain, how can a doubting conſcience be ſatisfied that Chriſt lay three dayes in the heart of the earth, according to the Prediction? Therefore as I have proved the time of Chriſts bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to be finiſhed when their Feſtival-Sabbath began to lighten by the Evening-ſtar, ſo I ſay alſo that the time of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was juſt about the time of Sun-riſing on the firſt day of the week.</p>
               <p>Chriſt did not riſe from his grave before day-break, as ſome would have it, nor at day-break, as others would have it, by uncertain gueſſes. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> went out of the door of her houſe in the firſt day of the week when it began to dawn, intending to perfume his burial with the ſweet Odors that ſhe had prepared in the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sabbath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 1. But <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, That the Sun was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36425:68"/>
juſt riſen when ſhe came to the Sepulchre, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 1. ſhe ſpent all that ſpace of time between day-break and Sun-riſing, partly in calling upon other holy women to go with her, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 10. and partly in going ſo much ground as was from her lodging to the Sepulchre, and then when ſhe was come to the Sepulchre, there was a mighty Earthquake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 2. and then his grave was opened; ſuch a like Earthquake there was at the death of Chriſt, which opened divers of the graves of the Saints, and after the Reſurrection of Chriſt, they did riſe alſo out of their graves, and came into the holy City, and appeared unto many, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 52, 53. By this Earthquake at Sun-riſing when <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> came to the Sepulchre, it is evident that Chriſt did not riſe out of his grave untill theſe holy women came to be witneſſes of the time of his Reſurrection. I confeſſe that many Interpreters do think that Chriſt was riſen before theſe holy Witneſſes came to the Sepulchre, but ſuch conjectures may not be admitted, for it is a point of neceſſary conſequence to be proved, That Chriſt lay three dayes in the heart of the Earth; but if you ſay, That Chriſt was riſen before theſe holy Witneſſes came, then you cannot cleerly prove that Chriſt lay three dayes in the heart of earth; for it may be demanded how long was he riſen before they came? If you ſay it was but one hour before, I may as well ſay it was ſeven or eight hours before, and then how can you ſatisfie a doubting conſcience that Chriſt lay three dayes, and three nights in the heart of the earth? I cannot think that Chriſt would ſuffer his own Prediction to remain ſo obſcure without manifeſt proof of the full accompliſhment of it: Therefore I conclude, that Chriſt roſe not out of his grave till the holy women came to be Witneſſes of the ſame, which was alſo evidently declared unto them by this Earth-quake at their coming to the Sepulchre, juſt at Sun-riſing, though they could not make that uſe of it till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>This Earthquake might be paſt before the holy women came to the Sepulchre, and they might know it afterward only by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt did never ſhew himſelf to any wicked man after his Reſurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20, 22. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 41. Therefore it is not like that he would make the Roman Souldiers to be the only Witneſſes of this Earthquake which did evidence the time
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36425:68"/>
of his Reſurrection. I conceive the holy women would not give much credit to the teſtimony of the Roman Souldiers, except this Earthquake had been general to all the parts of the City, as wel as to that particular place, but it ſeems to me that this Earthquake was not generally ſpread over the City, but it was limited only to that particular place where Chriſts Sepulchre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that place only where the Apoſtles were (when they were threatned by the Hgh Prieſts) was ſhaken as a teſtimony of encouragement to them, not to be afraid of Tyrants, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 31. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 7. and ſo there was an Earthquake that opened the particular place where <hi>Paul</hi> was impriſoned, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 26. the bare teſtimony of the Souldiers would have been but of ſmall credit to prove ſo weighty a matter as the time of Chriſts Reſurrection was<hi>:</hi> Therefore I conclude, that Chriſt aroſe not from his Grave till theſe holy women came to teſtifie the time of his Reſurrection by an Earthquake, which happened at their firſt coming to his Sepulchre, and that was juſt at Sun-riſing<hi>:</hi> I conceive that the holy women at firſt were amazed, and did not know what uſe to make of this Earthquake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 9. but afterwards they did plainly perceive that it was a manifeſt demonſtration of the time of his Reſurrection; and after this Earthquake, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> went to the Apoſtles, and told them that Chriſt was riſen from the dead, and ſhe followed the Apoſtles back again to the Sepulchre; And 3. when they ſaw no body in the Sepulchre, they returned home. 4 But <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſtaid ſtill behind; and then Chriſt himſelf did appear unto her as <hi>John</hi> doth teſtifie.</p>
               <p>From all the premiſes it is evident, that Chriſt lay in the heart of the earth about four hours of the ſixth day, and the whole Sabbath, and about five hours of the firſt day of the week, namely, from Mid-night till Sun-riſing; and after this ſort Chriſt lay three dayes, and three nights, in the heart of the Earth.</p>
               <p>But thoſe that begin the Sabbath at the Sun-ſet-Evening can never prove that Chriſt lay three dayes in the heart of the Earth: Therefore that opinion muſt needs be of evill conſequence: Firſt, Becauſe it falſifies the ſaid Prediction.
